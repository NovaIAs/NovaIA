Certainly! Here's a large and differentiated code written in Smalltalk:

```smalltalk
Object subclass: #MyLargeCode
    instanceVariableNames: ''
    classVariableNames: ''
    poolDictionaries: ''
    category: 'MyCode'

MyLargeCode class >> myMethod: anObject
    | result |
    result := anObject doSomething.
    Transcript show: 'Result: ', result asString; cr.
    self anotherMethod.

MyLargeCode class >> anotherMethod
    | list |
    list := OrderedCollection new.
    1 to: 10 do: [:i |
        list add: i].
    list shuffle.
    Transcript show: 'Shuffled List: ', list asString; cr.
    self yetAnotherMethod.

MyLargeCode class >> yetAnotherMethod
    | sum |
    sum := 0.
    (1 to: 100) do: [:i |
        sum := sum + i].
    Transcript show: 'Sum of Numbers from 1 to 100: ', sum asString; cr.
    self finalMethod.

MyLargeCode class >> finalMethod
    | sentence |
    sentence := 'This is the end of my large and differentiated code!'.
    Transcript show: sentence; cr.
    self cleanup.

MyLargeCode class >> cleanup
    Transcript show: 'Code cleanup completed!'; cr.

"Example usage:"
MyLargeCode myMethod: 42.
```

Explanation:

This code defines a class called `MyLargeCode` with several class methods. 

The `myMethod:` class method takes an object as a parameter, performs an action on it (represented by the `doSomething` message), and then displays the result using the Transcript tool. It also calls another class method called `anotherMethod`.

The `anotherMethod` class method creates an ordered collection and fills it with numbers from 1 to 10. It then shuffles the collection and displays the shuffled list using the Transcript tool. After that, it calls the `yetAnotherMethod` class method.

The `yetAnotherMethod` class method calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using a loop and displays the result using the Transcript tool. It then calls the `finalMethod` class method.

The `finalMethod` class method creates a sentence and displays it using the Transcript tool. It then calls the `cleanup` class method.

The `cleanup` class method simply displays a message indicating that the code cleanup is completed.

At the end of the code, there is an example usage of the `myMethod:` class method, where it is called with the parameter `42`. This will execute the code and display the results in the Transcript tool.
