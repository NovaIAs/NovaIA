Explanation:

* The `Object` class is the superclass of all classes in Smalltalk.
* The `LargeAndDifferentiated` class is a subclass of `Object`.
* The `>> new` method is the class method used to create new instances of the class. It takes one argument, `someAttribute`, which is the initial value of the `someAttribute` instance variable.
* The `>> someAttribute` method is the class method used to get the value of the `someAttribute` instance variable.
* The `>> someAttribute:` method is the class method used to set the value of the `someAttribute` instance variable.
* The `>> largeMethod` method is a very large method that does a lot of different things. It takes no arguments and returns a tuple containing the values of the `i`, `j`, and `k` local variables.
* The `[ i < 100 ] whileTrue: [...]` expression is a loop that executes the block between the square brackets while the condition `i < 100` is true.
* The `^ { i j k }` expression returns a tuple containing the values of the `i`, `j`, and `k` local variables.
