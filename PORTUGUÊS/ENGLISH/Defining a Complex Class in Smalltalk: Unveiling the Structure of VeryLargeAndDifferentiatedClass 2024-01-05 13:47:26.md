```smalltalk
Object subclass: VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedClass [
    classVariableNames: 'classVariable1 classVariable2'
    instanceVariableNames: 'instanceVariable1 instanceVariable2'

    classMethods: [
        classMethod1 [ | self | "class method 1" ]
        classMethod2 [ | self | "class method 2" ]
    ]

    instanceMethods: [
        instanceMethod1 [ | self | "instance method 1" ]
        instanceMethod2 [ | self | "instance method 2" ]
    ]
]
```

Explanation:

This code defines a new class named `VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedClass` in Smalltalk. It has class variables named `classVariable1` and `classVariable2`, and instance variables named `instanceVariable1` and `instanceVariable2`.

The class methods are `classMethod1` and `classMethod2`, and the instance methods are `instanceMethod1` and `instanceMethod2`. Each method is defined as a block of code that takes a single argument, `self`, which represents the object that the method is being called on.

To use this class, you would first create an instance of it using the `new` method:

```smalltalk
anObject := VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedClass new.
```

You can then call the instance methods on the object using the dot operator:

```smalltalk
anObject instanceMethod1.
anObject instanceMethod2.
```

You can also call the class methods on the class itself using the `>>` operator:

```smalltalk
VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedClass >> classMethod1.
VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedClass >> classMethod2.
```
