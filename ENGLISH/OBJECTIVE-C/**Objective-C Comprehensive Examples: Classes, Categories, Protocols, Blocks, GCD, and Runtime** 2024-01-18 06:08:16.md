Sure, here is a complex and differentiated code in Objective-C:

Objective-C Class with Properties and Methods:

```objective-c
@interface Person : NSObject

@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *name;
@property (nonatomic) NSUInteger age;

- (instancetype)initWithName:(NSString *)name age:(NSUInteger)age;

- (NSString *)description;

@end

@implementation Person

- (instancetype)initWithName:(NSString *)name age:(NSUInteger)age {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        _name = [name copy];
        _age = age;
    }
    return self;
}

- (NSString *)description {
    return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Name: %@, Age: %lu", _name, _age];
}

@end
```

Objective-C Category to Extend Functionality:

```objective-c
@interface Person (FullName)

- (NSString *)fullName;

@end

@implementation Person (FullName)

- (NSString *)fullName {
    NSArray *components = [self.name componentsSeparatedByString:@" "];
    NSString *firstName = components.firstObject;
    NSString *lastName = components.lastObject;
    return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ %@", firstName, lastName];
}

@end
```

Objective-C Protocol and Protocol Conformance:

```objective-c
@protocol Printable

- (NSString *)description;

@end

@interface Person : NSObject <Printable>

@end

@implementation Person

- (NSString *)description {
    return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Name: %@, Age: %lu", _name, _age];
}

@end
```

Objective-C Block Syntax and Usage:

```objective-c
NSArray *numbers = @[@1, @2, @3, @4, @5];

// Sort the array using a block to specify the comparison criteria
NSArray *sortedNumbers = [numbers sortedArrayUsingComparator:^NSComparisonResult(NSNumber *num1, NSNumber *num2) {
    return [num1 compare:num2];
}];

// Iterate over the array using a block to perform an action on each element
[sortedNumbers enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:^(NSNumber *number, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop) {
    NSLog(@"Number at index %lu: %@", idx, number);
}];
```

Objective-C Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) for Concurrency:

```objective-c
dispatch_queue_t backgroundQueue = dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0);
dispatch_async(backgroundQueue, ^{
    // Perform a time-consuming task in the background

    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
        // Update the UI on the main thread after the task is completed
    });
});
```

Objective-C Runtime and Method Swizzling:

```objective-c
// Original implementation of the method
- (void)originalMethod {
    NSLog(@"Original method implementation");
}

// Swizzled implementation of the method
- (void)swizzledMethod {
    NSLog(@"Swizzled method implementation");
    [self originalMethod]; // Call the original implementation
}

// Swizzle the method using runtime API
Method originalMethod = class_getInstanceMethod([self class], @selector(originalMethod));
Method swizzledMethod = class_getInstanceMethod([self class], @selector(swizzledMethod));
method_exchangeImplementations(originalMethod, swizzledMethod);
```


Explanation:

1. Class with Properties and Methods: This code defines a simple Person class with properties for name and age, along with an initializer and a description method.

2. Category to Extend Functionality: The category extends the Person class with a method to get the full name from the first and last names.

3. Protocol and Protocol Conformance: This code demonstrates protocol usage and conformance, defining a Printable protocol and making the Person class conform to it.

4. Block Syntax and Usage: This code showcases the use of blocks for sorting and iterating over an array, making use of functional programming techniques.

5. Grand Central Dispatch (GCD): This code demonstrates concurrent programming using GCD, running a task in the background and updating the UI on the main thread when it's complete.

6. Runtime and Method Swizzling: This code uses the Objective-C runtime API to swizzle (exchange) the implementations of two methods, allowing for method overriding at runtime.

This code covers various aspects of Objective-C, including object-oriented programming, protocols, blocks, concurrency, and runtime manipulation, making it a complex and differentiated example. It showcases the flexibility and power of Objective-C as a programming language.
