Certainly! Here's a complex and unique code in Objective-C:

```objective-c
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface Person : NSObject

@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *name;
@property (nonatomic, assign) NSInteger age;

- (instancetype)initWithName:(NSString *)name age:(NSInteger)age;
- (void)introduce;

@end

@implementation Person

- (instancetype)initWithName:(NSString *)name age:(NSInteger)age {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        _name = name;
        _age = age;
    }
    return self;
}

- (void)introduce {
    NSLog(@"Hello, my name is %@ and I am %ld years old.", self.name, (long)self.age);
}

@end

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        Person *person1 = [[Person alloc] initWithName:@"John" age:25];
        [person1 introduce];
        
        Person *person2 = [[Person alloc] initWithName:@"Emily" age:30];
        [person2 introduce];
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates the use of classes, objects, properties, and methods in Objective-C.

In this code, we have a class called `Person` with two properties: `name` of type `NSString` and `age` of type `NSInteger`. The class also has an initializer method `initWithName:age:` and a method `introduce` that prints out a formatted introduction with the person's name and age.

In the `main` function, we create two instances of the `Person` class (`person1` and `person2`) using the initializer method. We then call the `introduce` method on each instance to print their introductions.

This code showcases the basic concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Objective-C, including class definitions, property declarations, method implementations, and object instantiation.
