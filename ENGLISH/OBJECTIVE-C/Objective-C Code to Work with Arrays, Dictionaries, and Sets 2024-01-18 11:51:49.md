# Description
This code is a very large and complex example of Objective-C code. It demonstrates a variety of different features of the language, including arrays, dictionaries, sets, and mutable collections. The code also includes a number of different methods for creating and manipulating these collections.

The code begins by importing the necessary libraries. The `Foundation` library provides basic functionality for working with objects, data types, and files. The `AppKit` library provides functionality for working with the graphical user interface.

The `ComplexCode` class is defined next. This class contains a single method, `run`, which is responsible for running the code.

The `run` method begins by creating an array of integers, a dictionary of strings to integers, and a set of strings. The `NSArray`, `NSDictionary`, and `NSSet` classes are used to create these collections, respectively.

Next, the `run` method creates mutable versions of the array, dictionary, and set. The `NSMutableArray`, `NSMutableDictionary`, and `NSMutableSet` classes are used to create these mutable collections, respectively.

The `run` method then adds an element to the mutable array, a key-value pair to the mutable dictionary, and an element to the mutable set. The `addObject:`, `setObject:forKey:`, and `addObject:` methods are used to add elements to the mutable collections, respectively.

Finally, the `run` method prints the contents of the array, dictionary, set, mutable array, mutable dictionary, and mutable set. The `NSLog()` function is used to print the contents of the collections.

The output of the code is as follows:

```
Array: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Dictionary: {three = 3, two = 2, one = 1}
Set: {one, three, two}
Mutable Array: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
Mutable Dictionary: {three = 3, two = 2, one = 1, four = 4}
Mutable Set: {one, three, two, four}
```
