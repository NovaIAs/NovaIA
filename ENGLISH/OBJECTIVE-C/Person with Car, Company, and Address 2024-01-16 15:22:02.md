This code creates a new person object and sets the person's name, age, car, company, and address. It then prints the person's information to the console.

The code uses the following classes:

* `Person`: This class represents a person. It has properties for the person's name, age, car, company, and address.
* `Car`: This class represents a car. It has properties for the car's make, model, and year.
* `Address`: This class represents an address. It has properties for the address's street, city, state, and zip code.
* `Company`: This class represents a company. It has a property for the company's name and an address property.

The code first creates a new `Person` object and sets the person's name and age. It then creates a new `Car` object and sets the car's make, model, and year. It then creates a new `Address` object and sets the address's street, city, state, and zip code. It then creates a new `Company` object and sets the company's name and address.

The code then assigns the car and company to the person. It then prints the person's information to the console.

Finally, the code releases the objects. This is necessary to free up the memory that the objects are using.
