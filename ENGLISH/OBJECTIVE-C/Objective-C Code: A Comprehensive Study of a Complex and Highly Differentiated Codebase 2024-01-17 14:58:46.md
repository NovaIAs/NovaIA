Objective-C Code: A Comprehensive Study of a Complex and Highly Differentiated Codebase:

1. Class Definition:

@interface ComplexClass : NSObject
{
   // Declare private instance variables
   double value1;
   NSString *name;
   NSArray *list;
}

// Declare class methods
+ (void)classMethod1;

// Declare instance methods
- (void)instanceMethod1;
- (NSString *)instanceMethod2;

@end

Explanation:
   - The @interface directive defines the class interface.
   - The @implementation directive defines the class implementation.
   - The @interface and @implementation directives encapsulate the class definition and implementation.
   - NSObject is the base class for all Objective-C objects.
   - Instance variables are declared within curly braces {}.
   - Class methods are declared using the + sign before the method name.
   - Instance methods are declared without the + sign.
   - Property syntax (e.g., @property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *name;) can be used for modern Objective-C code.

2. Implementation:

@implementation ComplexClass

+ (void)classMethod1
{
   // Implementation of the class method
}

- (void)instanceMethod1
{
   // Implementation of the instance method
}

- (NSString *)instanceMethod2
{
   // Implementation of the instance method
   return @"Instance Method 2 Result";
}

@end

Explanation:
   - The @implementation directive is used to implement the class methods and instance methods.
   - The implementation details of the methods are provided within the method bodies.
   - The class method classMethod1 is implemented.
   - The instance method instanceMethod1 is implemented.
   - The instance method instanceMethod2 is implemented and returns a string.

3. Delegation:

@interface MyDelegate : NSObject <DelegateProtocol>
{
   // Declare instance variables
}

- (void)method1;
- (NSString *)method2;

@end

Explanation:
   - The MyDelegate class is declared to adopt the DelegateProtocol.
   - The protocol conformance is specified using the <DelegateProtocol> syntax.
   - The instance variables are declared within curly braces {}.
   - The instance methods method1 and method2 are declared.

4. Protocol Definition:

@protocol DelegateProtocol

- (void)protocolMethod1;
- (NSInteger)protocolMethod2;

@end

Explanation:
   - The DelegateProtocol protocol is defined.
   - The protocol methods protocolMethod1 and protocolMethod2 are declared.
   - Protocols provide a way to define a common interface for different classes to adopt.

5. Using Protocols:

@interface MyClass : NSObject
{
   // Declare instance variables
   id<DelegateProtocol> delegate;
}

- (void)useDelegate;

@end

@implementation MyClass

- (void)useDelegate
{
   // Check if the delegate conforms to the protocol
   if ([self.delegate conformsToProtocol:@protocol(DelegateProtocol)])
   {
      // Call the delegate methods
      [self.delegate protocolMethod1];
      NSInteger result = [self.delegate protocolMethod2];
      NSLog(@"Result: %ld", result);
   }
}

@end

Explanation:
   - The MyClass class is declared and an instance variable delegate is declared to be of type id<DelegateProtocol>.
   - The useDelegate method is implemented.
   - The useDelegate method checks if the delegate conforms to the DelegateProtocol using conformsToProtocol:.
   - If the delegate conforms to the protocol, the delegate methods protocolMethod1 and protocolMethod2 are called.
   - The result of protocolMethod2 is logged using NSLog.

This code demonstrates various advanced concepts in Objective-C, including class definition, implementation, delegation, and protocol usage. It showcases a complex and highly differentiated codebase with multiple classes, methods, and protocols, making it an excellent example for studying and understanding the language's capabilities.
