Explanation:

This program calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user. The program first prompts the user to enter a number and reads the number from the keyboard. The program then converts the ASCII code of the number to an integer. The program then initializes the factorial to 1 and enters a loop. The loop multiplies the factorial by the current value of the number and decrements the number by 1. The loop continues until the number reaches 0. The program then displays the result and exits.
