```assembly
; This program calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive function.

; The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less
; than or equal to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

; The program first prompts the user to enter a number. It then calls the factorial
; function to calculate the factorial of that number. The factorial function is a
; recursive function, which means that it calls itself to solve the problem.

; The factorial function takes two arguments: the number to calculate the factorial
; of, and a pointer to a memory location where the result should be stored. The
; function first checks to see if the number is equal to 0. If it is, then the
; factorial is 1. Otherwise, the function multiplies the number by the factorial
; of the number minus 1.

; The program then prints the factorial of the number to the console.

This program is more complex and differentiated than the previous one because it uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number. The factorial function is a more complex function than the add function, and it requires a more complex algorithm to implement. The program also uses a loop to convert the number from a string to an integer, and it uses a conditional statement to check for errors.
