```assembly
MOV AX, 0x1337 ; Load the value 0x1337 into the AX register
MOV BX, 0x4200 ; Load the value 0x4200 into the BX register
MOV CX, 0x1000 ; Load the value 0x1000 into the CX register

LOOP:
    MOV [BX], AX   ; Store the value in AX at the memory address pointed to by BX
    INC BX         ; Increment the value in BX by 1
    DEC CX         ; Decrement the value in CX by 1
    JNZ LOOP       ; Jump to the LOOP label if CX is not equal to 0

; The code above will store the value 0x1337 at every memory address from 0x4200 to 0x51FF.

XOR AX, AX      ; Clear the AX register
MOV BX, 0x4200 ; Load the value 0x4200 into the BX register

AGAIN:
    CMP [BX], 0x1337 ; Compare the value at the memory address pointed to by BX with 0x1337
    JNE SKIP      ; Jump to the SKIP label if the values are not equal
    INC AX         ; Increment the value in AX by 1
SKIP:
    INC BX         ; Increment the value in BX by 1
    CMP BX, 0x5200 ; Compare the value in BX with 0x5200
    JBE AGAIN      ; Jump to the AGAIN label if BX is less than or equal to 0x5200

; The code above will count the number of times the value 0x1337 appears in the memory range from 0x4200 to 0x51FF. The count will be stored in the AX register.

MOV DX, 0x0300 ; Load the value 0x0300 into the DX register
MOV AH, 0x0E   ; Load the value 0x0E into the AH register
INT 0x21        ; Call the BIOS interrupt 0x21 with AH = 0x0E and DX = 0x0300

; The code above will print the value in the AX register to the console.

HLT             ; Halt the processor
```

This code will store the value 0x1337 at every memory address from 0x4200 to 0x51FF, then count the number of times the value 0x1337 appears in that memory range, and finally print the count to the console.

The code is complex and differentiated because it uses a loop to store the value 0x1337 in memory, another loop to count the number of times the value appears in memory, and a BIOS interrupt to print the count to the console. The code also uses a variety of registers and instructions, which makes it difficult to understand.
