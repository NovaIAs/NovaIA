; This program calculates the factorial of a number

; Declare the variables

factorial:   equ     0       ; The variable to store the factorial in

; Initialize the factorial to 1
mov     ax, 1
mov     [factorial], ax

; Loop through the numbers from 2 to the number
mov     cx, 2
loop:
    ; Multiply the factorial by the current number
    mul     cx

    ; Increment the current number
    inc     cx

    ; Check if we've reached the end of the loop

This program is a bit more complex than the previous one, but it's still relatively easy to understand. It starts by defining the variables that will be used in the program. Then, it initializes the factorial to 1. Next, it enters a loop that runs from 2 to the number that we want to calculate the factorial of. Inside the loop, the factorial is multiplied by the current number. After the loop, the factorial is printed to the console. Finally, the program returns to DOS.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The `.data` segment defines the data that will be used in the program. In this case, it defines the variable `number` and the variable `factorial`.
* The `.code` segment defines the code that will be executed by the program.
* The `start:` label marks the beginning of the program.
* The `call main` instruction calls the `main` function.
* The `ret` instruction returns to DOS.
* The `main:` label marks the beginning of the `main` function.
* The `mov bx, [number]` instruction moves the value of the variable `number` into the BX register.
* The `mov cx, 1` instruction moves the value 1 into the CX register.
* The `loop:` label marks the beginning of the loop.
* The `mul cx` instruction multiplies the value in the AX register by the value in the CX register.
* The `inc cx` instruction increments the value in the CX register by 1.
* The `cmp cx, bx` instruction compares the value in the CX register to the value in the BX register.
* The `jl loop` instruction jumps to the `loop:` label if the value in the CX register is less than the value in the BX register.
* The `mov ah, 4Ch` instruction moves the value 4Ch into the AH register.
* The `mov dx, ax` instruction moves the value in the AX register into the DX register.
* The `int 21h` instruction calls the DOS interrupt 21h, which prints the value in the DX register to the console.
* The `ret` instruction returns to the caller.
