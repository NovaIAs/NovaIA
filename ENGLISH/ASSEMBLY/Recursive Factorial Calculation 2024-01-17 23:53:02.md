This program calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive function. The factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

The program first prompts the user to enter a number. Then, it converts the number to an integer and calls the factorial function to calculate the factorial of the number. The factorial function is a recursive function, which means that it calls itself. The function takes the number to calculate the factorial of as an argument and returns the factorial of the number.

The function first checks if the number is equal to 1. If it is, then the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function subtracts 1 from the number and calls itself with the new number as the argument. The function continues to do this until the number is equal to 1.

Once the function reaches the base case, it starts returning the results of the function calls. The function multiplies the number by the result of the function call and returns the result. The function continues to do this until it reaches the original function call.

The program then displays the factorial of the number to the user. The program uses the printf function to format the output and display it to the user. The program then exits.
