; Start of the program
main:

    ; Print the message
    mov ah, 0x0e ; Set interrupt to print string
    mov al, msg ; Set the message to print
    int 0x10 ; Call the interrupt to print the message

Explanation:

* The first line (`.data`) defines the data segment, where data variables are stored.
* The second line (`.byte`) defines a byte variable named `msg` that contains the string `"Hello, world!"`, followed by a newline character (10) and a dollar sign (`$`).
* The third line (`.code`) defines the code segment, where the program instructions are stored.
* The fourth line (`main:`) is the entry point of the program, where execution begins.
* The fifth line (`mov ah, 0x0e`) sets the value of the AH register to 0x0e, which is the interrupt number for printing a string.
* The sixth line (`mov al, msg`) sets the value of the AL register to the address of the `msg` variable, which contains the message to print.
* The seventh line (`int 0x10`) calls the interrupt 0x10, which prints the string stored in the AL register.
* The eighth line (`mov ah, 0x4c`) sets the value of the AH register to 0x4c, which is the interrupt number for exiting the program.
* The ninth line (`int 0x21`) calls the interrupt 0x21, which exits the program.
