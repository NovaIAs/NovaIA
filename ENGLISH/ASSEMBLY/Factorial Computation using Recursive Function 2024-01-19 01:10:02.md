This program is a bit more complex than the previous one. It uses a recursive function to compute the factorial of a number. A recursive function is a function that calls itself. In this case, the factorial function calls itself to compute the factorial of a number that is one less than the current number.

The program first prompts the user to enter a number. It then calls the factorial function to compute the factorial of the number. Finally, it prints the result to the console.

The factorial function is defined as follows:

```
fact(n) = n * fact(n-1) if n > 1
fact(1) = 1
```

This means that the factorial of a number is the product of the number and the factorial of the number that is one less than it. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

The program uses a loop to call the factorial function recursively. The loop decrements the number by 1 each time it calls the factorial function. The loop continues until the number reaches 1. When the number reaches 1, the factorial function returns 1.

The program then multiplies the current factorial by the previous factorial and returns the result. The program continues to multiply the current factorial by the previous factorial until it reaches the factorial of the original number.

The program then prints the factorial of the number to the console.
