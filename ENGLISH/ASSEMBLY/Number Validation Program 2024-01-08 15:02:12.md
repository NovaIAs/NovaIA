Explanation:

- The code starts with the `.model small` directive, which specifies that the program will be compiled for a small memory model. This means that the program will be limited to 64K of memory.

- The `.stack 100h` directive reserves 100h (256 bytes) of memory for the stack. The stack is a temporary storage area used by the program to store data and return addresses.

- The `.data` segment is used to define data variables. In this case, we have three data variables:

    - `msg1` is a string that contains the message "Enter a number between 1 and 9: $".
    - `msg2` is a string that contains the message "The number you entered is: ".
    - `result` is a byte variable that will be used to store the user's input.

- The `.code` segment is used to define the program's instructions. The program starts with the `start:` label.

- The `mov ax, @data` instruction moves the address of the `.data` segment into the AX register. This tells the program where to find the data variables.

- The `mov ds, ax` instruction moves the contents of the AX register into the DS register. This sets the DS register to point to the `.data` segment.

- The `lea dx, msg1` instruction loads the address of the `msg1` string into the DX register.

- The `mov ah, 9` instruction sets the AH register to 9. This tells the BIOS to print a string.

- The `int 21h` instruction interrupts the BIOS and tells it to print the string in the DX register.

- The `mov ah, 1` instruction sets the AH register to 1. This tells the BIOS to read a character from the keyboard.

- The `int 21h` instruction interrupts the BIOS and tells it to read a character from the keyboard. The character is stored in the AL register.

- The `sub al, 48` instruction subtracts 48 from the value in the AL register. This converts the ASCII code of the character to its numeric value.

- The `cmp al, 1` instruction compares the value in the AL register to 1. If the value is less than 1, the program jumps to the `invalid` label.

- The `cmp al, 9` instruction compares the value in the AL register to 9. If the value is greater than 9, the program jumps to the `invalid` label.

- The `mov bl, al` instruction moves the value in the AL register into the BL register.

- The `mov ah, 2` instruction sets the AH register to 2. This tells the BIOS to display a character.

- The `int 21h` instruction interrupts the BIOS and tells it to display the character in the BL register.

- The `lea dx, result` instruction loads the address of the `result` variable into the DX register.

- The `mov ah, 2` instruction sets the AH register to 2. This tells the BIOS to read a character from the keyboard.

- The `int 21h` instruction interrupts the BIOS and tells it to read a character from the keyboard. The character is stored in the AL register.

- The `lea dx, msg2` instruction loads the address of the `msg2` string into the DX register.

- The `mov ah, 9` instruction sets the AH register to 9. This tells the BIOS to print a string.

- The `int 21h` instruction interrupts the BIOS and tells it to print the string in the DX register.

- The `mov ah, 4ch` instruction sets the AH register to 4ch. This tells the BIOS to exit the program.

- The `int 21h` instruction interrupts the BIOS and tells it to exit the program.

- The `invalid` label is used to jump to if the user enters an invalid number.

- The `lea dx, invalid_msg` instruction loads the address of the `invalid_msg` string into the DX register.

- The `mov ah, 9` instruction sets the AH register to 9. This tells the BIOS to print a string.

- The `int 21h` instruction interrupts the BIOS and tells it to print the string in the DX register.

- The `mov ah, 4ch` instruction sets the AH register to 4ch. This tells the BIOS to exit the program.

- The `int 21h` instruction interrupts the BIOS and tells it to exit the program.

- The `invalid_msg` variable is a string that contains the message "Invalid number entered".
