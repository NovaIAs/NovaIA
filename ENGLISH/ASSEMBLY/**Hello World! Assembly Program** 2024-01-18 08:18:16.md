Explanation:

1. **Data Segment**: The data segment contains the data used by the program, including the message to be displayed.

2. **Code Segment**: The code segment contains the instructions that tell the computer what to do.

3. **Start of the Program**: The `start:` label marks the beginning of the program.

4. **Loading the Address of the Message into DS Register**: The `mov ax, data_segment` instruction loads the address of the data segment into the AX register. The `mov ds, ax` instruction then copies the value of AX into the DS register, which points to the start of the data segment.

5. **Displaying the Message**: The `mov ah, 9` instruction sets the AH register to 9, which is the DOS function code for displaying a string. The `mov dx, offset message` instruction loads the offset of the message variable into the DX register. The `int 21h` instruction then interrupts the operating system and executes the DOS function to display the message.

6. **Waiting for a Key Press**: The `mov ah, 1` instruction sets the AH register to 1, which is the DOS function code for reading a character from the keyboard. The `int 21h` instruction then interrupts the operating system and executes the DOS function to read a character.

7. **Exiting the Program**: The `mov ax, 4c00h` instruction sets the AX register to 4c00h, which is the DOS function code for exiting the program. The `int 21h` instruction then interrupts the operating system and executes the DOS function to exit the program.

8. **End of Program**: The `end start` directive marks the end of the program and specifies the starting label of the program.

This code is complex because it performs multiple operations, including loading a message from the data segment, displaying it on the screen, waiting for a key press, and exiting the program. Additionally, it uses various DOS function calls to interact with the operating system.
