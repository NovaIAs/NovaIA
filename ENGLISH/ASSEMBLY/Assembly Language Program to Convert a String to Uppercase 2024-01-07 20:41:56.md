; This is a very large and differentiated code in assembly language.
; It is unlikely to be repeated again.

; The code is divided into several sections, each of which performs a different task.

; The first section defines the data structures that will be used by the code.

DATA_SEGMENT
    ; Define a buffer to store the input string.
    INPUT_BUFFER BYTE 256 DUP (0)

    ; Define a buffer to store the output string.
    OUTPUT_BUFFER BYTE 256 DUP (0)

    ; Define a table of ASCII character codes.
    ASCII_CODES BYTE 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z'

This code is a very large and differentiated code in assembly language. It is unlikely to be repeated again. The code is divided into several sections, each of which performs a different task.

The first section defines the data structures that will be used by the code. The second section defines the code that will be executed by the program. The third section defines the data that will be used by the program. The fourth section defines the code that will be executed when the program is terminated. The fifth section defines the end of the program.

The code is very complex and difficult to understand. It is not recommended for beginners.
