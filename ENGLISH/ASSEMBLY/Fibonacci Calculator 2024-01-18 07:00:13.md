This code is an assembly language program that calculates the Fibonacci number for a given input value. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1, and the sequence continues as follows:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The program uses a recursive algorithm to calculate the Fibonacci number. The algorithm works by calling itself twice, with the input value decremented by 1 each time. The base case of the recursion is when the input value is 0 or 1, in which case the algorithm simply returns the input value.

The program also includes some error checking to make sure that the input value is a valid Fibonacci number. If the input value is less than 0, the program exits and displays an error message.

The program uses the DOS interrupt 21h to get input from the user and display output to the console.

The program is written in a relatively complex style, with a lot of jumps and conditional branches. This makes it difficult to understand and follow, but it is also very efficient.
