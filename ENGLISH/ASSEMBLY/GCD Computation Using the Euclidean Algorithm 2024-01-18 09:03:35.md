This code is a bit longer and more complex than the previous one, but it is still a relatively simple program. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

The program starts by declaring the input and output variables. The input variables are the two numbers that we want to find the GCD of, and the output variable is the GCD itself.

Next, the program declares the main function. The main function is the entry point for the program, and it is where the program execution begins.

Inside the main function, the program first gets the input numbers from the user. It does this by calling the `li` instruction to load the value 5 into the register `$v0`. The `li` instruction is used to load an immediate value into a register. The value 5 is the system call number for the `read` system call. The `syscall` instruction is used to make a system call. The `read` system call reads a line of text from the standard input and stores it in the buffer pointed to by the register `$a0`.

After getting the input numbers, the program stores them in the input variables. It does this by calling the `sw` instruction to store the value of the register `$v0` in the memory location pointed to by the register `$a0`. The `sw` instruction is used to store a word (32 bits) in memory.

Next, the program computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is a simple and efficient algorithm for computing the GCD of two numbers. It works by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number and taking the remainder. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder.

The program starts by initializing the registers `$t0` through `$t31` to zero. These registers will be used to store the intermediate values during the GCD computation.

Next, the program checks if the first number is greater than the second number. It does this by calling the `bgt` instruction to branch to the start label if the first number is greater than the second number. The `bgt` instruction is used to branch to a label if the first register is greater than the second register.

If the first number is greater than the second number, the program swaps the two numbers. It does this by calling the `sw` instruction to store the value of the register `$t0` in the memory location pointed to by the register `$a0`. The `sw` instruction is used to store a word (32 bits) in memory.

Next, the program computes the remainder of the first number divided by the second number. It does this by calling the `div` instruction to divide the first number by the second number. The `div` instruction divides the first register by the second register and stores the quotient in the register `$hi` and the remainder in the register `$lo`.

Next, the program checks if the remainder is zero. It does this by calling the `beq` instruction to branch to the end label if the remainder is zero. The `beq` instruction is used to branch to a label if the first register is equal to the second register.

If the remainder is not zero, the program stores the remainder in the second number variable. It does this by calling the `sw` instruction to store the value of the register `$t2` in the memory location pointed to by the register `$a0`. The `sw` instruction is used to store a word (32 bits) in memory.

Next, the program repeats the process until the remainder is zero. It does this by calling the `j` instruction to jump to the start label. The `j` instruction is used to jump to a label.

Once the remainder is zero, the program stores the second number in the GCD variable. It does this by calling the `sw` instruction to store the value of the register `$t0` in the memory location pointed to by the register `$a0`. The `sw` instruction is used to store a word (32 bits) in memory.

Finally, the program prints the GCD to the console. It does this by calling the `li` instruction to load the value 1 into the register `$v0`. The `li` instruction is used to load an immediate value into a register. The value 1 is the system call number for the `write` system call. The `syscall` instruction is used to make a system call. The `write` system call writes a line of text to the standard output from the buffer pointed to by the register `$a0`.

After printing the GCD, the program exits. It does this by calling the `li` instruction to load the value 10 into the register `$v0`. The `li` instruction is used to load an immediate value into a register. The value 10 is the system call number for the `exit` system call. The `syscall` instruction is used to make a system call. The `exit` system call terminates the program.

This is a relatively simple program, but it is a good example of how assembly language can be used to solve a real-world problem.
