```

This code allocates memory for an array of 10 integers, initializes the array with the value 1, prints the array, and then deallocates the memory for the array.

The code uses the following system calls:

* `malloc`: Allocates memory for the array.
* `free`: Deallocates the memory for the array.

The code also uses the following assembly instructions:

* `pushq`: Pushes a value onto the stack.
* `movq`: Moves a value from one register to another.
* `call`: Calls a function.
* `ret`: Returns from a function.
* `leave`: Restores the base pointer.
* `rep`: Repeats an instruction a specified number of times.
* `stosw`: Stores a word (16 bits) in memory.
* `movsw`: Moves a word (16 bits) from memory to a register.

The code is well-commented and easy to understand. It is also efficient and uses the minimum number of instructions necessary to accomplish the task.
