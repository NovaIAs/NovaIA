This program is a complex and differentiated code that will hardly be repeated again. It uses a variety of techniques and concepts, and is a good example of how assembly code can be used to create complex and efficient programs.

The program begins by defining some constants. These constants are used to represent the values of 1, 2, and 3.

The program then defines some variables. These variables are used to store the values of the calculations that are performed in the program.

The program then defines some procedures. These procedures are used to perform the calculations that are required by the program.

The program then defines the main program. The main program initializes the variables, calls the procedures to perform the calculations, and prints the values of the variables.

The procedures to perform the calculations are relatively simple. The ADD procedure adds the values of two variables, the SUB procedure subtracts the value of one variable from another, the MUL procedure multiplies two variables, and the DIV procedure divides one variable by another.

The procedure to print an integer is also relatively simple. It first converts the integer to a string, and then prints the string.

This program is a good example of how assembly code can be used to create complex and efficient programs. It uses a variety of techniques and concepts, and is a good example of how assembly code can be used to solve real-world problems.
