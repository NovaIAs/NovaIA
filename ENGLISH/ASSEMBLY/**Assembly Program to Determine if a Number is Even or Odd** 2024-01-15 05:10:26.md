**Explanation:**

This assembly program is designed to read a number from the user and determine if it is even or odd. Here's how the code works:

1. **Data Segment**:
   - `msg1` and `msg2` are two string literals used to display messages to the user.

2. **Code Segment**:
   - `start` is the entry point of the program.

3. **Displaying the Prompt Message**:
   - The `mov ax, @data` and `mov ds, ax` instructions set up the data segment register (DS) to point to the data segment.
   - The `mov ah, 09h` instruction sets the AH register to 09h, which is the DOS interrupt for displaying a string.
   - The `lea dx, msg1` instruction loads the address of the `msg1` string into the DX register.
   - The `int 21h` instruction interrupts the operating system to display the string.

4. **Reading the Input Number**:
   - The `mov ah, 01h` instruction sets the AH register to 01h, which is the DOS interrupt for reading a character from the keyboard.
   - The `int 21h` instruction interrupts the operating system to read a character.
   - The `sub al, '0'` instruction subtracts the ASCII code of '0' (48) from the input character to convert it to an integer.

5. **Checking if the Number is Even or Odd**:
   - The `cmp al, 0` instruction compares the value in the AL register (which contains the input number) with 0.
   - If the number is equal to 0, it means it is even, so the program jumps to the `even` label. Otherwise, it jumps to the `odd` label.

6. **Displaying the Result**:
   - In the `even` and `odd` labels, the program displays the appropriate message to the user using the same method as in step 3.

7. **Exiting the Program**:
   - The `mov ah, 4ch` instruction sets the AH register to 4ch, which is the DOS interrupt for exiting the program.
   - The `int 21h` instruction interrupts the operating system to exit the program.

This program demonstrates the use of basic assembly instructions to read input, perform calculations, and display output. It is a good example of how assembly language can be used to create simple programs.
