; This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.

; The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers.
; The first two numbers in the series are 0 and 1.

; The program will ask the user for the number of terms to calculate, and then it will print the sequence.

; Define the variables that will be used in the program.

term_count: DWORD ? ; The number of terms to calculate
fibonacci_sequence: DWORD ? ; The array that will store the Fibonacci sequence
index: DWORD ? ; The index of the current term in the sequence

; Get the number of terms to calculate from the user.

This program is a bit more complex than the previous one. It uses a loop to calculate the Fibonacci sequence, and it also uses a function to print the sequence. The program also uses a data segment to store the Fibonacci sequence.

Here is a brief explanation of the program:

* The program starts by defining the variables that will be used in the program.
* The program then calls the `get_term_count` function to get the number of terms to calculate from the user.
* The program then calls the `calculate_fibonacci_sequence` function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence.
* The program then calls the `print_fibonacci_sequence` function to print the sequence.
* The program then calls the `exit` function to exit the program.

The program uses a loop to calculate the Fibonacci sequence. The loop starts by initializing the first two terms of the sequence to 0 and 1. The loop then iterates through the remaining terms of the sequence, calculating each term by adding the previous two terms.

The program uses a function to print the Fibonacci sequence. The function takes the array containing the sequence and the length of the sequence as arguments. The function then uses a loop to print each term of the sequence.

The program uses a data segment to store the Fibonacci sequence. The data segment is located at the beginning of the program, and it contains the array that will store the sequence.

The program uses a function to exit the program. The function takes the exit code as an argument. The function then calls the `exit` system call to exit the program.

The program is a bit more complex than the previous one, but it is still relatively easy to understand. The program uses a loop to calculate the Fibonacci sequence, and it also uses a function to print the sequence. The program also uses a data segment to store the Fibonacci sequence.
