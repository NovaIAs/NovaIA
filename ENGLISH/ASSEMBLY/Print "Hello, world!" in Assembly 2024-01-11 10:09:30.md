main:
    # Print the message "Hello, world!" to the console
    mov rax, 1
    mov rdi, 1
    mov rsi, message

    syscall

    # Print a newline to the console
    mov rax, 1
    mov rdi, 1
    mov rsi, newline

Explanation:

* The `.data` section defines a data area in the program. In this case, it defines two strings: `message` and `newline`.
* The `.text` section defines the code area in the program. In this case, it defines the `main` function.
* The `mov` instruction is used to move data from one register to another.
* The `rax`, `rdi`, `rsi`, and `rdx` registers are used to pass arguments to system calls.
* The `syscall` instruction is used to make a system call. In this case, the `syscall` instruction is used to print the message "Hello, world!" to the console and to exit the program.
