; This program calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive function.

; The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number.
; For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

; The program first prompts the user to enter a number.
; It then calls the factorial function to calculate the factorial of that number.
; The factorial function is a recursive function, which means that it calls itself.
; The factorial function takes two arguments: the number to calculate the factorial of, and a pointer to the result.
; The factorial function first checks if the number is equal to 1.
; If it is, then the factorial function returns 1.
; Otherwise, the factorial function multiplies the number by the factorial of the number minus 1.
; The factorial function then returns the result.

; The program then prints the factorial of the number to the console.

This program is a complex and differentiated code in assembly language that calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive function. The program first prompts the user to enter a number, then calls the factorial function to calculate the factorial of that number, and finally prints the factorial of the number to the console. The factorial function is a recursive function, which means that it calls itself. The factorial function takes two arguments: the number to calculate the factorial of, and a pointer to the result. The factorial function first checks if the number is equal to 1. If it is, then the factorial function returns 1. Otherwise, the factorial function multiplies the number by the factorial of the number minus 1. The factorial function then returns the result. The program uses the `atoi` function to convert the user's input from a string to an integer. The program uses the `syscall` function to print messages to the console and to read input from the user. The program uses the `strlen` function to get the length of a string. The program uses the `exit` function to exit the program.
