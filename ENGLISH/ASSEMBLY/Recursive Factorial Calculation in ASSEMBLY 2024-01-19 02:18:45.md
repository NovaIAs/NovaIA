```assembly
; This program is a complex and differentiated code in ASSEMBLY that will hardly be repeated again.

; The program calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive function.

; The main function receives a number as a parameter and calls the recursive function to calculate the factorial.

main:
    mov rdi, 5 ; Number to calculate the factorial of
    call factorial
    mov rax, rdi ; Store the result in the rax register
    ret

; The recursive function calculates the factorial of a number.

factorial:
    cmp rdi, 1 ; Check if the number is equal to 1
    je done ; If it is, return 1
    dec rdi ; Otherwise, decrement the number
    call factorial ; Call the function recursively with the decremented number
    mul rdi ; Multiply the result by the number
    ret

; The done label is used to return from the recursive function.

done:
    mov rdi, 1 ; Return 1
    ret

; The program ends here.
```

Explanation:

* The main function receives a number as a parameter and calls the recursive function factorial to calculate the factorial of the number.
* The factorial function checks if the number is equal to 1. If it is, it returns 1. Otherwise, it decrements the number and calls the function recursively with the decremented number.
* The function then multiplies the result by the number and returns the result.
* The done label is used to return from the recursive function when the number is equal to 1.
* The program ends with the ret instruction in the main function.
