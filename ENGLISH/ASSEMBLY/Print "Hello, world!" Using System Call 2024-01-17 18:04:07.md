; Define the size of the message

.text
; Declare the main function
.global main

; Define the main function
main:
    ; Push the message address onto the stack
    pushl $message

    ; Push the message size onto the stack
    pushl $message_size

    ; Call the write system call to print the message
    call write

    ; Exit the program
    movl $0, %eax
    ret

; Declare the write system call
.extern write
```
This code is a simple program that prints the message "Hello, world!" to the console. It does this by first pushing the address of the message and the size of the message onto the stack. Then, it calls the write system call, which prints the message to the console. Finally, the program exits by returning a value of 0 to the operating system.

This code is different from the previous examples in a few ways. First, it uses a different data directive, .asciiz, to define the message. This directive allows the message to contain newlines, which are represented by the \n escape sequence. Second, it uses the pushl instruction to push the message address and size onto the stack. This is necessary because the write system call expects its arguments to be passed on the stack. Finally, it uses the call instruction to call the write system call. This instruction transfers control to the write system call, which then prints the message to the console.

This code is also more complex than the previous examples because it uses a system call. A system call is a way for a program to request a service from the operating system. In this case, the write system call is used to print the message to the console.
