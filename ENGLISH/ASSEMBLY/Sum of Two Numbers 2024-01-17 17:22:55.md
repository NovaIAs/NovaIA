This code is a complete program that calculates the sum of two numbers entered by the user. The program first prompts the user to enter the first number, then the second number. It then adds the two numbers together and displays the sum to the console.

The program is written in assembly language, which is a low-level programming language that is used to directly control the hardware of a computer. Assembly language is often used for writing operating systems and other low-level software.

The code is divided into three sections:

* The data segment contains the data that the program uses, such as the numbers entered by the user and the sum of the two numbers.
* The text segment contains the instructions that the program executes.
* The stack segment is used to store temporary data, such as the return addresses of function calls.

The program begins by calling the print_string function to prompt the user to enter the first number. The print_string function takes a string as its argument and prints it to the console.

The program then calls the read_number function to read the number entered by the user. The read_number function reads a number from the console character by character and converts it to an integer.

The program then calls the print_string function to prompt the user to enter the second number.

The program then calls the read_number function to read the number entered by the user.

The program then calls the add function to add the two numbers together. The add function takes two numbers as its arguments and returns the sum of the two numbers.

The program then calls the print_string function to display the sum of the two numbers to the console.

The program then calls the newline function to print a newline to the console.

Finally, the program calls the exit function to exit the program. The exit function takes an exit code as its argument. The exit code is a number that is used by the operating system to determine whether the program was successful or not.
