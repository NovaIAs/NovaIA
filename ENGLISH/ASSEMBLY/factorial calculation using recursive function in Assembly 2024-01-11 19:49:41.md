This code calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive function. The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

The code starts by declaring the function prototype for the factorial function. The function takes a single argument, which is the number to calculate the factorial of. The function returns the result of the calculation.

The code then declares a global variable to store the result of the calculation. The variable is declared as a DWORD, which is a 32-bit unsigned integer.

The main program starts by getting the input from the user. The user is prompted to enter a number, and the input is stored in the variable `num`.

The code then converts the input to a DWORD and calls the factorial function. The function is called with the value of `num` as the argument.

The factorial function first checks if the number is 0. If the number is 0, the function returns 1. This is because the factorial of 0 is defined to be 1.

If the number is not 0, the function recursively calls itself with the number minus 1 as the argument. This process continues until the number reaches 0.

When the number reaches 0, the function returns 1. This is the base case for the recursion.

The function then multiplies the result of the recursive call by the current number. This is done by using the `imul` instruction.

Finally, the function returns the result of the calculation.

The main program then displays the result of the calculation to the user.

The code works by using a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number. The function calls itself repeatedly until the number reaches 0. The function then returns the result of the calculation.
