EXPLANATION:

1. `START:`: This is the entry point of the program.

2. `XOR AX,AX`: Clear the AX register to zero.

3. `MOV CX,2`: Initialize the CX register to 2. This is the starting value for the prime number search.

4. `SEG:`: Use a label `SEG` to allow for looping. 

5. `ADD AX,CX`: Add the value in CX to the value in AX. This effectively multiplies CX by 2 and adds it to AX.

6. `DIV CX`: Divide AX by CX. This operation calculates the remainder of dividing AX by CX and stores the result in AX.

7. `JZ END`: Compare the remainder in AX to zero. If the remainder is zero, it means that AX is evenly divisible by CX, indicating that AX is not a prime number. In this case, the program jumps to the `END` label.

8. `INC CX`: If AX is not divisible by CX, the program increments CX by 1. This checks the next potential divisor.

9. `JMP SEG`: Jump back to the `SEG` label to continue the loop with the updated value of CX.

10. `END:`: This label marks the end of the loop. The program proceeds to display the values of AX and CX using the PRINT directive.

11. `CMP CX,100`: Compare CX with 100 to check if the program has generated 100 prime numbers.

12. `JE EXIT`: If CX is equal to 100, it means that 100 prime numbers have been generated, so the program jumps to the `EXIT` label.

13. `JMP SEG`: If CX is not equal to 100, the program jumps back to the `SEG` label to continue generating prime numbers.

14. `EXIT:`: This label marks the end of the program. The program terminates by moving 4C00h into AX, which is the DOS interrupt for exiting the program, and then issuing the INT 21h instruction, which triggers the interrupt.

15. `DATA SEGMENT` and `@DATA ENDS`: These lines define the data segment for the program, but there is no data declared in this example.
