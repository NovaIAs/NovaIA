; Define a constant.

; Define a variable.

; Entry point of the program.
START:

; Load the constant into a register.

This code demonstrates several different features of the assembly language.

* **Constants:** Constants are defined using the `equ` directive. A constant is a value that cannot be changed during the execution of the program. In this code, the constant `MY_CONSTANT` is defined to be equal to 10.
* **Variables:** Variables are defined using the `db` directive. A variable is a value that can be changed during the execution of the program. In this code, the variable `MY_VARIABLE` is defined to be a single byte.
* **Loading and storing:** The `mov` instruction is used to load a value into a register or to store a value from a register to memory. In this code, the `mov` instruction is used to load the constant `MY_CONSTANT` into the `ax` register, to add the variable `MY_VARIABLE` to the `ax` register, and to store the result back into the variable `MY_VARIABLE`.
* **Arithmetic:** The `add` instruction is used to add two values together. In this code, the `add` instruction is used to add the variable `MY_VARIABLE` to the `ax` register.
* **Exiting the program:** The `ret` instruction is used to exit the program. In this code, the `ret` instruction is used to exit the program after the value of the variable `MY_VARIABLE` has been updated.
