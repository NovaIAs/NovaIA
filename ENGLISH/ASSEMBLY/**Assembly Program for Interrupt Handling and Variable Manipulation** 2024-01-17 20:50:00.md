Explanation:

* The ORG directive sets the origin of the program to $1000. This means that the program will be loaded into memory starting at address $1000.
* The LDX and STX instructions are used to initialize the stack pointer. The stack pointer is used to keep track of the current position of the stack.
* The LDA and STA instructions are used to initialize the variables. Two variables are used in this program: $0001 and $0002.
* The LOOP label marks the beginning of the main program loop. The loop will continue to execute until the variable $0002 is equal to $05.
* The LDA, CMP, and BNE instructions are used to compare the variable $0002 with the value $05. If the two values are not equal, the program will branch to the NEXT label.
* The INC instruction is used to increment the variable $0001.
* The JMP instruction is used to jump to the beginning of the loop.
* The ISR label marks the beginning of the interrupt service routine. The interrupt service routine will be executed when an interrupt occurs.
* The LDA, CMP, and BNE instructions are used to check if the interrupt was caused by a specific event. In this case, the interrupt was caused by a specific event if the variable $00FF is equal to $FF.
* The LDA, INC, and STA instructions are used to handle the interrupt. In this case, the variable $0003 is incremented.
* The RTI instruction is used to return from the interrupt service routine.
* The END directive marks the end of the program.
