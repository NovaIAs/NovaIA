```

This code calculates the first 100 factorial numbers and stores them in memory. It then prints the results to the console.

The code starts by initializing the registers. The accumulator (eax) is cleared to 0, and the base register (ebx) is set to 1.

The code then enters a loop that runs through the numbers from 1 to 100. In each iteration of the loop, the accumulator is multiplied by the base register, and the result is stored in memory. The base register is then incremented, and the loop counter (ecx) is decremented. The loop continues until the loop counter reaches 0.

After the loop has finished, the code prints the results to the console. The system call number for "write" (4) is loaded into the eax register, the file descriptor for stdout (1) is loaded into the ebx register, the address of the message to print (message) is loaded into the ecx register, and the length of the message (len(message)) is loaded into the edx register. The system call is then made by executing the int 0x80 instruction.

Finally, the code exits the program by loading the system call number for "exit" (1) into the eax register, the exit code (0) into the ebx register, and executing the int 0x80 instruction.
