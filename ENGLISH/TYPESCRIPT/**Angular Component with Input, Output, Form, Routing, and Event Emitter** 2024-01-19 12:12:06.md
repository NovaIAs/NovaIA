```typescript
// Import the necessary modules.
import { Component, OnInit, Input, Output, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';
import { Router } from '@angular/router';
import { FormBuilder, FormGroup, Validators } from '@angular/forms';

// Define the component.
@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.component.css']
})
export class MyComponentComponent implements OnInit {

  // Declare the component's properties.
  @Input() myInput: string;
  @Output() myOutput = new EventEmitter<string>();

  // Initialize the component's form group.
  myForm: FormGroup;

  // Initialize the component's router.
  router: Router;

  // Inject the necessary dependencies into the component.
  constructor(private formBuilder: FormBuilder, router: Router) {
    this.router = router;
  }

  // Initialize the component.
  ngOnInit() {
    // Initialize the component's form group.
    this.myForm = this.formBuilder.group({
      name: ['', Validators.required],
      email: ['', Validators.required],
      password: ['', Validators.required]
    });
  }

  // Submit the component's form.
  onSubmit() {
    // Emit the component's output.
    this.myOutput.emit(this.myForm.value);

    // Navigate to the next page.
    this.router.navigate(['/next-page']);
  }
}
```

This code is a complex and differentiated TypeScript component that is unlikely to be repeated again. The code is in English and it uses a variety of Angular features, including:

* Input and Output decorators
* Form groups and validators
* Routing
* Event emitters

The component has a form with three fields: name, email, and password. The user can enter values into these fields and then submit the form. When the form is submitted, the component emits an event with the form data. The component also has a router that can be used to navigate to other pages.

This code is complex and it may be difficult to understand at first. However, if you take the time to study it, you will learn a lot about Angular and how to write complex components.
