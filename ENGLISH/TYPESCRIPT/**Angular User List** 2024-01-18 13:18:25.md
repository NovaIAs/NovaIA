```typescript
// Import the necessary libraries.
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

// Define the component.
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']

export class AppComponent implements OnInit {

  // Define the properties of the component.
  public users: any[];

  // Define the constructor of the component.
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }

  // Define the ngOnInit method of the component.
  ngOnInit(): void {
    // Make a GET request to the API to get the list of users.
    this.http.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users').subscribe(
      (data: any[]) => {
        // Store the list of users in the users property.
        this.users = data;
      }
    );
  }
}
```

This code is a Typescript component for an Angular application. It uses the HttpClient library to make a GET request to an API to get a list of users. The list of users is then stored in the users property of the component.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The `import` statements at the top of the file import the necessary libraries.
* The `@Component` decorator defines the component. The `selector` property specifies the HTML tag that will be used to instantiate the component. The `templateUrl` property specifies the HTML template file for the component. The `styleUrls` property specifies the CSS style sheet files for the component.
* The `AppComponent` class implements the `OnInit` interface. This interface has a single method, `ngOnInit`, which is called when the component is initialized.
* The `ngOnInit` method makes a GET request to the API to get the list of users. The `http.get()` method takes a URL as its first argument and a callback function as its second argument. The callback function is called when the request is complete.
* The callback function takes a single argument, `data`, which is the response from the API. The callback function stores the list of users in the `users` property of the component.
* The HTML template file for the component is not shown in this code. It would typically contain HTML elements that display the list of users.
