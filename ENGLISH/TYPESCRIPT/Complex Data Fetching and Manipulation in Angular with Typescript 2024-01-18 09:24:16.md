```typescript
// This is a sample Typescript code that demonstrates a complex and differentiated implementation.

// Import necessary modules.
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

// Define the main component.
@Component({
  selector: 'app-complex-code',
  templateUrl: './complex-code.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./complex-code.component.css']
})

// Implement the component class.
export class ComplexCodeComponent implements OnInit {
  
  // Declare variables and initialize them.
  data: any[] = [];

  // Inject the HttpClient service for making HTTP requests.
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }

  // Component initialization logic.
  ngOnInit(): void {
    // Make an HTTP GET request to fetch data.
    this.http.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos')
    .pipe(
      // Use the map operator to transform the response data.
      map((response: any) => {
        // Filter out completed tasks.
        return response.filter((task: any) => !task.completed);
      })
    )
    .subscribe(data => {
      // Assign the transformed data to the data property.
      this.data = data;
    });
  }

  // Define a method to toggle the completion status of a task.
  toggleTask(task: any) {
    // Update the task's completed property.
    task.completed = !task.completed;
  }
}
```

Explanation:

* The code uses Angular's Component decorator to define a component named `ComplexCodeComponent`.


* The `ngOnInit` method is called when the component is initialized. Inside this method, the `HttpClient` service is used to make an HTTP GET request to fetch data from a remote server.


* The `map` operator is used to transform the response data. In this case, it filters out completed tasks from the response.


* The `subscribe` method is used to listen for the response from the HTTP request. Once the response is received, it is assigned to the `data` property of the component.


* The `toggleTask` method is defined to toggle the completion status of a task when it is clicked.


* The HTML template file (`complex-code.component.html`) is responsible for displaying the data in a user-friendly format.


* The CSS stylesheet file (`complex-code.component.css`) is used to style the component's appearance.
