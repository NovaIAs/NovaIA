```typescript
// Import the necessary libraries.
import { Component, OnInit, Input, Output, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';

// Define the component.
@Component({
  selector: 'app-complex-component',
  templateUrl: './complex-component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./complex-component.css']
})

// Implement the component class.
export class ComplexComponent implements OnInit {

  // Define the input and output properties.
  @Input() data: any;
  @Output() result: EventEmitter<any> = new EventEmitter();

  // Define the local variables.
  private _processedData: any;

  // Initialize the component.
  ngOnInit(): void {
    this._processInputData();
  }

  // Define the private methods.
  private _processInputData(): void {
    // Perform complex data processing here.
    this._processedData = this.data;
  }

  // Define the public methods.
  public calculateResult(): void {
    // Perform complex calculations here.
    const result = this._processedData;
    this.result.emit(result);
  }

}
```

Explanation:

* The `@Component` decorator defines the component's metadata, including its selector, template, and styles.
* The `@Input()` and `@Output()` decorators define the component's input and output properties, respectively.
* The `ngOnInit()` lifecycle hook is called after the component is initialized and its input properties are set.
* The `_processInputData()` method is a private method that encapsulates the complex data processing logic.
* The `calculateResult()` method is a public method that encapsulates the complex calculation logic.
* The `result` event emitter is used to emit the result of the calculation to the parent component.

This code is complex because it performs a series of complex data processing and calculation tasks. It also uses a number of advanced Angular features, such as decorators, lifecycle hooks, and event emitters.
