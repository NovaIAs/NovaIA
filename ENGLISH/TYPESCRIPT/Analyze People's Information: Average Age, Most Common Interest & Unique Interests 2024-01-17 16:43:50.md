// Define a TypeScript interface for a Person object

// Create an array of Person objects

// Define a function to get the average age of the people in the array
const getAverageAge = (people: Person[]): number => {
  // Calculate the total age of the people in the array
  const totalAge = people.reduce((acc, person) => acc + person.age, 0);

  // Calculate the average age by dividing the total age by the number of people

  }

  // Convert the set of unique interests to an array and return it
  return Array.from(uniqueInterests);
};

// Print the average age of the people
console.log('Average age:', getAverageAge(people));

// Print the most common interest among the people
console.log('Most common interest:', getMostCommonInterest(people));

// Print the unique interests among the people
console.log('Unique interests:', getUniqueInterests(people));
```

**Explanation:**

This TypeScript code defines a Person interface, creates an array of Person objects, and defines three functions:

1. `getAverageAge`: Calculates the average age of the people in the array.
2. `getMostCommonInterest`: Finds the most common interest among the people in the array.
3. `getUniqueInterests`: Gets the unique interests among the people in the array.

The code then prints the average age, the most common interest, and the unique interests among the people in the array.
