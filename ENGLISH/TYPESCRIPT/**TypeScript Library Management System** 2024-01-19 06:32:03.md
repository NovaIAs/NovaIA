Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. We define an `interface` called `Book` which represents a book and has properties like `title`, `author`, `isbn`, and `price`.

2. We create a class called `Library` which has a private `books` array to store books and various methods to add, get, remove, and update books in the library.

3. We create a new library instance and add some books to it using the `addBook` method.

4. We retrieve all books in the library using the `getAllBooks` method.

5. We retrieve a book by its ISBN using the `getBookByISBN` method.

6. We remove a book from the library by its ISBN using the `removeBookByISBN` method.

7. We update a book in the library by its ISBN using the `updateBookByISBN` method.

8. At various points in the code, we print information about the books in the library to the console for demonstration purposes.

This code demonstrates various OOP concepts like classes, interfaces, and methods, as well as data manipulation and storage in JavaScript using TypeScript.
