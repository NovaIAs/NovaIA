```typescript
// typescript code

// Import the necessary libraries
import * as React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch, Link, useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

// Define the main component
const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <nav>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
          <Link to="/about">About</Link>
          <Link to="/users">Users</Link>
        </nav>

        {/* Define the routes */}
        <Switch>
          <Route exact path="/">
            <Home />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/about">
            <About />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/users">
            <Users />
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

// Define the Home component
const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home</h1>
      <p>This is the home page.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// Define the About component
const About = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>This is the about page.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// Define the Users component
const Users = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Users</h1>
      <p>This is the users page.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// Render the App component to the DOM
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

```

This TypeScript code defines a single-page application (SPA) using the React framework and React Router for routing. It includes navigation links and corresponding routes for a home page, an about page, and a users page. The code sets up the necessary imports, defines the main App component, and renders it to the DOM using ReactDOM.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Imports**:
   - `import * as React from 'react'`: Imports the React library, allowing us to use React components and hooks.
   - `import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'`: Imports theReactDOM library, which is used to render React components to the DOM.
   - `import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch, Link, useParams } from 'react-router-dom'`: Imports the necessary components from React Router for routing.

2. **App Component**:
   - The App component is the main component of the application. It defines the navigation links and the routes for the different pages.

3. **Navigation Links**:
   - The `<Link>` components are used to create navigation links for the home, about, and users pages.

4. **Routes**:
   - The `<Switch>` component is used to define the routes for the different pages.
   - The `<Route>` components define the paths for each page and specify which component to render for that path.

5. **Home, About, and Users Components**:
   - These are the individual components for the home, about, and users pages. Each component defines the content to be displayed on its respective page.

6. **Rendering**:
   - The ReactDOM.render method is used to render the App component to the DOM element with the id "root".

This code demonstrates the use of TypeScript for creating a React SPA with multiple pages and routing.
