```typescript
// Polymorphic function that takes a list of values and a function that accepts a single value,
// and applies the function to each value in the list.
const map = <T, U>(list: T[], f: (value: T) => U): U[] => {
  return list.reduce((acc: U[], curr: T) => {
    acc.push(f(curr));
    return acc;
  }, []);
};

// Function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers.
const sum = (numbers: number[]): number => {
  return numbers.reduce((acc: number, curr: number) => acc + curr, 0);
};

// Function that takes a list of strings and returns a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the list.
const concatenate = (strings: string[]): string => {
  return strings.reduce((acc: string, curr: string) => acc + curr, '');
};

// List of numbers to sum.
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// List of strings to concatenate.
const strings: string[] = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];

// Apply the map function to the list of numbers and the sum function to get the sum of the numbers.
const sumOfNumbers: number = map(numbers, sum);

// Apply the map function to the list of strings and the concatenate function to get the concatenation of the strings.
const concatenatedString: string = map(strings, concatenate);

// Display the results.
console.log(`The sum of the numbers is: ${sumOfNumbers}`);
console.log(`The concatenation of the strings is: ${concatenatedString}`);
```

Explanation:

1. The `map` function is a generic function that takes a list of values and a function that accepts a single value. It applies the function to each value in the list and returns a list of the results. In this case, the `map` function is used to apply the `sum` function to a list of numbers and the `concatenate` function to a list of strings.

2. The `sum` function takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. It uses the `reduce` function to add each number in the list to the accumulator, starting with an initial value of 0.

3. The `concatenate` function takes a list of strings and returns a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the list. It uses the `reduce` function to add each string in the list to the accumulator, starting with an initial value of an empty string.

4. The `numbers` and `strings` variables are lists of numbers and strings, respectively.

5. The `map` function is called with the `numbers` list and the `sum` function as arguments, and the result is assigned to the `sumOfNumbers` variable.

6. The `map` function is called with the `strings` list and the `concatenate` function as arguments, and the result is assigned to the `concatenatedString` variable.

7. The `console.log()` statements are used to display the results.

This code demonstrates the use of generic functions, higher-order functions, and the `reduce` function in TypeScript. It also shows how to use TypeScript to write polymorphic code that can be applied to different types of data.
