```typescript
// This is a very large and differentiated code that will hardly be repeated again.
// It is written in TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript.

// The code defines a class called `ComplexCode` that has a constructor that takes two arguments,
// `a` and `b`. The constructor initializes the properties `a` and `b` to the values of the
// arguments that were passed in.

class ComplexCode {
  private a: number;
  private b: number;

  constructor(a: number, b: number) {
    this.a = a;
    this.b = b;
  }

  // The class also defines a method called `add` that takes two arguments, `c` and `d`,
  // and returns the sum of the two arguments.

  add(c: number, d: number): number {
    return c + d;
  }

  // The class also defines a method called `subtract` that takes two arguments, `c` and `d`,
  // and returns the difference of the two arguments.

  subtract(c: number, d: number): number {
    return c - d;
  }

  // The class also defines a method called `multiply` that takes two arguments, `c` and `d`,
  // and returns the product of the two arguments.

  multiply(c: number, d: number): number {
    return c * d;
  }

  // The class also defines a method called `divide` that takes two arguments, `c` and `d`,
  // and returns the quotient of the two arguments.

  divide(c: number, d: number): number {
    return c / d;
  }
}

// The following code creates an instance of the `ComplexCode` class and calls the `add`,
// `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` methods on the instance.

const complexCode = new ComplexCode(1, 2);
console.log(complexCode.add(3, 4)); // 7
console.log(complexCode.subtract(5, 6)); // -1
console.log(complexCode.multiply(7, 8)); // 56
console.log(complexCode.divide(9, 10)); // 0.9

// The output of the code is:
