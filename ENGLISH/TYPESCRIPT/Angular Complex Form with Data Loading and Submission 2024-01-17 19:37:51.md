```typescript
// Import the necessary modules.
import { Component, OnInit, Input } from '@angular/core';
import { FormBuilder, FormGroup, Validators } from '@angular/forms';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

// Define the component.
@Component({
  selector: 'app-complex-component',
  templateUrl: './complex-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./complex-component.component.css']
})

// Implement the component.
export class ComplexComponent implements OnInit {

  // Define the input properties.
  @Input() data: any;

  // Define the form group.
  form: FormGroup;

  // Inject the FormBuilder, HttpClient, and data services.
  constructor(private fb: FormBuilder, private http: HttpClient, private dataService: DataService) { }

  // Initialize the component.
  ngOnInit() {
    // Create the form group.
   form = this.fb.group({
      name: ['', Validators.required],
      email: ['', Validators.email],
      password: ['', Validators.minLength(8)]
    });

    // Load the data from the data service.
    this.dataService.getData().subscribe(data => {
      this.data = data;
    });
  }

  // Submit the form.
  onSubmit() {
    // Check if the form is valid.
    if (this.form.invalid) {
      return;
    }

    // Send the data to the server.
    this.http.post('http://example.com/api/submit', this.form.value).subscribe(data => {
      // Handle the response from the server.
    });
  }
}

**Explanation:**

* The `ComplexComponent` is a component in Angular, which is a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications.
* The component has several input properties, including `data`, which is used to pass data to the component from the parent component.
* The component also has a form group, which is used to collect user input and validate it.
* The component uses the `HttpClient` service to make HTTP requests to a server.
* The component also uses a `DataService` service to load data from a server.
* The component has a `onSubmit` method, which is called when the user clicks the submit button. This method checks if the form is valid and then sends the data to the server.

This code is complex because it uses a variety of Angular features, including input properties, form groups, HTTP requests, and services. It also has a lot of logic for handling user input and sending data to a server. This code would be difficult to write and maintain for a beginner, but it is a good example of how to use Angular to create complex and powerful applications.
