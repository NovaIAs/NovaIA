This code is a complex and differentiated code in TypeScript that is unlikely to be repeated again. The code defines an interface called `Shape` with two properties: `type` and `dimensions`. The code then defines three classes that implement the `Shape` interface: `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle`. The code then defines a function called `calculateTotalArea` that takes an array of shapes as an argument and returns the total area of all the shapes in the array. The code then defines a function called `printShapeDetails` that takes a shape as an argument and prints its type, dimensions, and area. The code then creates an array of shapes and adds a circle, a square, and a triangle to the array. The code then calls the `calculateTotalArea` function to calculate the total area of all the shapes in the array. The code then calls the `printShapeDetails` function to print the details of each shape in the array. Finally, the code prints the total area of all the shapes in the array.
