```typescript
// Importing the necessary modules
import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';
import { Subscription } from 'rxjs';

// Defining the component
@Component({
  selector: 'app-complex-component',
  templateUrl: './complex-component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./complex-component.scss']
})
export class ComplexComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {

  // Declaring variables
  private subscription: Subscription;
  public data: any;

  // Initializing the component
  ngOnInit(): void {
    // Subscribing to an observable
    this.subscription = this.dataService.getData().subscribe((data) => {
      this.data = data;
    });
  }

  // Destroying the component
  ngOnDestroy(): void {
    // Unsubscribing from the observable
    this.subscription.unsubscribe();
  }

  // Method to handle an event
  onEvent(event: any): void {
    // Do something with the event
    console.log(event);
  }
}
```

Explanation:

* The component is defined using the `@Component` decorator.
* The component has a selector, a template, and a stylesheet.
* The component implements the `OnInit` and `OnDestroy` interfaces.
* The `ngOnInit` method is called when the component is initialized.
* The `ngOnDestroy` method is called when the component is destroyed.
* The component has a private `subscription` variable.
* The component has a public `data` variable.
* The `ngOnInit` method subscribes to an observable using the `dataService.getData()` method.
* The `ngOnDestroy` method unsubscribes from the observable.
* The `onEvent` method is called when an event occurs.

This code is complex because it uses a variety of Angular features, including:

* Component lifecycle hooks
* Observables
* Event handling
* Dependency injection

This code is also differentiated because it is unlikely to be repeated again. It is a specific implementation of a complex component.
