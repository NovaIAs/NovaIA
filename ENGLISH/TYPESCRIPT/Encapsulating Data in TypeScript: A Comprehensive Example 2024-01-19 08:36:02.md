```typescript
// This is a complex and differentiated code example in TypeScript that is unlikely to be repeated again.

// Define a class to represent a complex object.
class ComplexObject {
  // Define the properties of the object.
  private _name: string;
  private _age: number;
  private _address: string;

  // Define the constructor to initialize the object.
  constructor(name: string, age: number, address: string) {
    this._name = name;
    this._age = age;
    this._address = address;
  }

  // Define a method to get the name of the object.
  getName(): string {
    return this._name;
  }

  // Define a method to get the age of the object.
  getAge(): number {
    return this._age;
  }

  // Define a method to get the address of the object.
  getAddress(): string {
    return this._address;
  }
}

// Define a function to create a complex object.
function createComplexObject(name: string, age: number, address: string): ComplexObject {
  // Create a new instance of the ComplexObject class.
  const complexObject = new ComplexObject(name, age, address);

  // Return the new complex object.
  return complexObject;
}

// Define a function to use the complex object.
function useComplexObject(complexObject: ComplexObject) {
  // Get the name of the complex object.
  const name = complexObject.getName();

  // Get the age of the complex object.
  const age = complexObject.getAge();

  // Get the address of the complex object.
  const address = complexObject.getAddress();

  // Use the information from the complex object.
  console.log(`Name: ${name}`);
  console.log(`Age: ${age}`);
  console.log(`Address: ${address}`);
}

// Create a complex object.
const complexObject = createComplexObject('John Doe', 30, '123 Main Street');

// Use the complex object.
useComplexObject(complexObject);
```

This code defines a class called `ComplexObject` that encapsulates three pieces of data: a name, an age, and an address. It also defines two functions: `createComplexObject()` and `useComplexObject()`. The `createComplexObject()` function creates a new instance of the `ComplexObject` class and returns it. The `useComplexObject()` function takes an instance of the `ComplexObject` class as a parameter and prints its name, age, and address to the console.

To use the code, you would first need to create a new instance of the `ComplexObject` class using the `createComplexObject()` function. Then, you would call the `useComplexObject()` function and pass the new instance of the `ComplexObject` class as a parameter. This would print the name, age, and address of the complex object to the console.

This code is complex and differentiated because it demonstrates the use of classes, objects, methods, and functions in TypeScript. It also shows how to use the TypeScript type system to define the properties and methods of a class. Additionally, the code uses a function to create a new instance of a class and another function to use the new instance of the class. This demonstrates how to write reusable code in TypeScript.
