This code is a procedure called `AdaPoetry` that uses Ada's tasking features to display a poem about Ada and the current value of a stock ticker.

The procedure first defines a string variable called `Component` and initializes it to the string "Ada." It then defines a new type called `StockTicker` that is a string of length 10. A variable called `StockQuote` of type `StockTicker` is declared and initialized to the string "ORCL."

The procedure then defines a procedure called `DisplayPoem` that takes two parameters: a string called `Stanza` and a character called `FirstCharacter.` The `DisplayPoem` procedure displays the first character of the stanza followed by the entire stanza. It does this by looping through the stanza string and displaying each character.

The main part of the `AdaPoetry` procedure then calls the `DisplayPoem` procedure four times, passing in different stanzas and first characters. This displays the poem about Ada.

Finally, the `AdaPoetry` procedure displays the value of the `StockQuote` variable. It does this by calling the `Put_Line` procedure to display the string "The value of " followed by the value of the `StockQuote` variable. It then calls the `New_Line` procedure to display a new line.
