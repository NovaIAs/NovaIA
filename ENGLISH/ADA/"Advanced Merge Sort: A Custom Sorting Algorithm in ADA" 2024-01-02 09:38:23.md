Certainly! Here's a complex and differentiated code written in ADA. This code implements a custom sorting algorithm called "Advanced Merge Sort" that combines merge sort and quicksort techniques to achieve optimal performance. Let me explain the code section by section:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;
with Ada.Integer_Text_IO;
use Ada.Text_IO;
use Ada.Integer_Text_IO;

procedure Advanced_Merge_Sort is
   type Int_Array is array (Natural range <>) of Integer;

   procedure Merge (Arr : in out Int_Array; Low, Mid, High : Integer) is
      L : Int_Array (1 .. Mid - Low + 1);
      R : Int_Array (1 .. High - Mid);
      L_Index, R_Index, Merged_Index : Integer := 1;

   begin
      for I in Low .. Mid loop
         L (L_Index) := Arr (I);
         L_Index := L_Index + 1;
      end loop;

      for I in Mid + 1 .. High loop
         R (R_Index) := Arr (I);
         R_Index := R_Index + 1;
      end loop;

      L (L_Index) := Integer'Last;
      R (R_Index) := Integer'Last;

      L_Index := 1;
      R_Index := 1;

      for I in Low .. High loop
         if L (L_Index) <= R (R_Index) then
            Arr (I) := L (L_Index);
            L_Index := L_Index + 1;
         else
            Arr (I) := R (R_Index);
            R_Index := R_Index + 1;
         end if;
      end loop;
   end Merge;

   procedure Quick_Sort (Arr : in out Int_Array; Low, High : Integer) is
      Pivot, I, J : Integer;

   begin
      if Low < High then
         Pivot := Arr (High);
         I := Low - 1;

         for J in Low .. High - 1 loop
            if Arr (J) <= Pivot then
               I := I + 1;
               Swap (Arr (I), Arr (J));
            end if;
         end loop;

         Swap (Arr (I + 1), Arr (High));

         Quick_Sort (Arr, Low, I);
         Quick_Sort (Arr, I + 2, High);
      end if;
   end Quick_Sort;

   procedure Advanced_Merge_Sort (Arr : in out Int_Array; Low, High : Integer) is
      Mid : Integer;

   begin
      if High - Low + 1 < 20 then
         Quick_Sort (Arr, Low, High);
      else
         Mid := (Low + High) / 2;

         Advanced_Merge_Sort (Arr, Low, Mid);
         Advanced_Merge_Sort (Arr, Mid + 1, High);

         Merge (Arr, Low, Mid, High);
      end if;
   end Advanced_Merge_Sort;

   Arr_Size : Integer;
   Arr : Int_Array (1 .. Arr_Size);

begin
   Put ("Enter the size of the array: ");
   Get (Arr_Size);

   Put_Line ("Enter the elements of the array:");
   for I in 1 .. Arr_Size loop
      Get (Arr (I));
   end loop;

   Advanced_Merge_Sort (Arr, 1, Arr_Size);

   Put_Line ("Sorted array:");
   for I in 1 .. Arr_Size loop
      Put (Arr (I)'Image & " ");
   end loop;
   New_Line;
end Advanced_Merge_Sort.
```

This code implements the "Advanced Merge Sort" algorithm. It starts by declaring a type `Int_Array` as an array of integers. The algorithm uses two main procedures:

1. `Merge`: This procedure merges two sub-arrays of `Arr`. It takes the input array `Arr` and the indices `Low`, `Mid`, and `High` to determine the two sub-arrays to merge. The procedure first creates two temporary arrays `L` and `R` to hold the left and right sub-arrays. Then, it iterates over the range `Low` to `Mid` to populate `L` with the corresponding elements from `Arr`, and from `Mid + 1` to `High` to populate `R`. Afterwards, sentinel values are added to the end of `L` and `R` to indicate the end of each sub-array. Finally, the procedure compares elements from `L` and `R` one by one, and merges them back into `Arr` in ascending order.

2. `Quick_Sort`: This procedure performs the partition step of the Quicksort algorithm. It takes the input array `Arr` and the indices `Low` and `High` to determine the range of elements to sort. The procedure selects the pivot element as the last element of the range. It then iterates over the range, moving elements smaller than or equal to the pivot to the left side of the current partition. After the loop, the pivot is placed in its final sorted position, and the procedure is recursively called for the sub-ranges to the left and right of the pivot.

The main `Advanced_Merge_Sort` procedure performs a hybrid of merge sort and quicksort. If the size of the array (`High - Low + 1`) is less than 20, it calls `Quick_Sort` for efficient small array sorting. Otherwise, it calculates the midpoint, and recursively calls itself to sort the left and right sub-arrays. Finally, it calls `Merge` to merge the sorted sub-arrays into the final sorted array.

In the main program, the user is prompted to enter the size of the array and its elements. The `Advanced_Merge_Sort` procedure is then called with the array and its range to sort the array. Finally, the sorted array is printed to the console.

This code provides a custom sorting algorithm that combines the best aspects of merge sort and quicksort to achieve efficient sorting performance, making it a differentiated solution for sorting large arrays.
