This program reads a list of words from standard input, sorts them in alphabetical order, and prints them to standard output.

The program first declares a type `Word_Array` which is an array of strings of length 1 to 20. It then declares a variable `Words` of type `Word_Array` with a size of 10000. This variable will be used to store the words that are read from standard input.

The program then declares a variable `Word_Count` of type `Positive` and initializes it to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the number of words that have been read from standard input.

The program then declares a procedure `Read_Words` which takes a file as an input parameter. The procedure reads words from the file and stores them in the `Words` array. The procedure uses the `Get` procedure from the `Ada.Text_IO` package to read a word from the file. The procedure continues reading words from the file until the end of the file is reached.

The program then declares a procedure `Sort_Words` which sorts the words in the `Words` array in alphabetical order. The procedure uses the `Generic_Array_Sort` procedure from the `Ada.Containers.Generic_Array_Sort` package to sort the array. The procedure passes the `Indices` array as the first parameter and the `Words` array as the second parameter. The `Indices` array contains the indices of the words in the `Words` array. The `Generic_Array_Sort` procedure sorts the `Indices` array in such a way that the words in the `Words` array are sorted in alphabetical order.

The program then declares a procedure `Print_Sorted_Words` which prints the sorted words to standard output. The procedure uses the `Put` procedure from the `Ada.Text_IO` package to print a word to standard output. The procedure continues printing words to standard output until all of the words have been printed.

The program then calls the `Read_Words` procedure to read the words from standard input. The program then calls the `Sort_Words` procedure to sort the words in alphabetical order. The program then calls the `Print_Sorted_Words` procedure to print the sorted words to standard output.
