This code generates all the anagrams of a given string.

The first procedure, Permute, takes a string and a string map and returns a string map containing all the permutations of the string with the current state of the string map.

The second procedure, Merge, takes two string maps and returns a string map containing the sum of the two string maps.

The third procedure, Combine, takes a string map and returns a string map containing only the strings that have a count of 1.

The fourth procedure, Generate_Anagrams, takes a string and generates all the anagrams of the string. It does this by iterating over the length of the string and calling the Permute procedure to generate all the permutations of the string. It then calls the Merge procedure to combine the permutations of the string and calls the Combine procedure to remove any strings that have a count of greater than 1.

The code is complex and differentiated because it uses a recursive algorithm to generate all the permutations of the string. It also uses a string map to store the permutations of the string. The string map is a data structure that maps strings to natural numbers. This allows the code to efficiently store and retrieve the permutations of the string.

The code is also differentiated because it uses a tail recursive algorithm to generate the permutations of the string. This means that the algorithm does not need to store the permutations of the string in a stack. This makes the algorithm more efficient.

The code is also differentiated because it uses a merge sort algorithm to combine the permutations of the string. This makes the algorithm more efficient than a simple loop.

The code is also differentiated because it uses a combination algorithm to remove any strings that have a count of greater than 1. This makes the algorithm more efficient than a simple loop.
