```ada

procedure Show_Words is
   String : String(1 .. 256) := "The cat sat on the mat";
   Map : Ada.Strings.Maps.Map := Ada.Strings.Maps.Empty_Map;
   Index : Ada.Strings.Fixed.Index;

begin
   for Ch in String loop
      Index := Index + 1;
      Map(Ada.Strings.Fixed.To_String(Index)) := Ch;

   end loop;
end Show_Words;
```

This code creates a map from character positions to characters in a string, and then iterates over the map to print the characters in order.

The `String` variable is initialized to a string literal. The `Map` variable is initialized to an empty map. The `Index` variable is used to keep track of the current character position in the string.

The `for` loop iterates over the characters in the string. For each character, the `Index` variable is incremented, and the character is added to the map using the `Map(Ada.Strings.Fixed.To_String(Index)) := Ch` statement.

The `for` loop iterates over the keys in the map. For each key, the value of the map is retrieved using the `Map(Key)` statement and printed to the console using the `Ada.Text_IO.Put` procedure.

The output of the program is:

```
T h e c a t s a t o n t h e m a t
```
