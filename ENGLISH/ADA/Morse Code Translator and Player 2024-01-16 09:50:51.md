This code is a Morse code translator and player. It takes a string of characters as input and translates it to Morse code. It then plays the Morse code using a simple sound player.

The code is divided into several parts:

* The first part defines the Morse code table. This table maps each character to its corresponding Morse code symbol.
* The second part defines the `Sound_Symbol` function, which returns the duration of a Morse code symbol.
* The third part defines the `Play` procedure, which plays a Morse code symbol.
* The fourth part defines the `Play_Character` procedure, which plays a single character in Morse code.
* The fifth part defines the `Play_String` procedure, which plays a string of characters in Morse code.

The main part of the code is the `Morse_Code` procedure. This procedure takes a list of command-line arguments and plays each argument in Morse code.

To use the code, you can compile it using the Ada compiler. You can then run the resulting executable with a list of command-line arguments. For example, the following command would play the message "Hello, world!" in Morse code:

```
./morse_code Hello, world!
```

The code is complex because it involves several different concepts, including data structures, functions, procedures, and loops. It is also large because it includes a large Morse code table. However, the code is well-organized and easy to understand.
