This code performs complex matrix multiplication. Both matrices are complex, meaning they have both real and imaginary parts. The code uses a complex data type to represent the complex numbers and a matrix data type to represent the matrices.

The code first defines the constant `Digits`, which specifies the size of the matrices. The constant `Digits_Plus_One` is defined as `Digits` plus one, which is the size of the matrices including the zeroth row and column.

The code then defines the constant `Pi` as an approximation of the mathematical constant Ï€.

The code then defines a type `Matrix` which is an array of arrays of floats. This type is used to represent the matrices.

The code then defines a type `Complex` which is a record with two fields, `Re` and `Im`, which are both floats. This type is used to represent the complex numbers.

The code then declares three variables of type `Matrix`: `Matrix_A`, `Matrix_B`, and `Matrix_C`. These variables are used to store the three matrices involved in the matrix multiplication.

The code then declares a variable of type `Complex` called `CN`. This variable is used to store temporary complex numbers.

The code then defines a procedure called `Complex_Multiplication` which takes two complex numbers as input and returns their product as output. The procedure uses the standard complex multiplication formula to compute the product.

The code then defines a procedure called `Matrix_Multiplication` which takes two matrices as input and returns their product as output. The procedure uses the standard matrix multiplication algorithm to compute the product.

The code then defines a procedure called `Output_Matrix` which takes a matrix as input and prints it to the console. The procedure uses a loop to iterate over the rows and columns of the matrix, and for each element it prints the element to the console.

Finally, the code calls the `Output_Matrix` procedure to print the result of the matrix multiplication to the console.
