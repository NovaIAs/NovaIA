This code implements the N-queens problem in Ada. The N-queens problem is a classic computer science problem that asks how to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

The code begins by defining a subtype `Board_Index` which represents the indices of the rows and columns of the chessboard. It then defines a type `Board_Type` which is an array of booleans that represents the state of the chessboard, with `True` indicating that there is a queen in that cell and `False` indicating that there is no queen in that cell.

The `Clear_Board` procedure clears the chessboard by setting all cells to `False`.

The `No_Conflict` function checks if placing a queen in a given cell would result in a conflict with any other queens on the board. It does this by checking the row, column, and diagonals of the cell.

The `Place_Queen` procedure places a queen in a given cell by setting the corresponding element of the chessboard array to `True`.

The `Is_Solution` function checks if the current state of the chessboard is a solution to the N-queens problem. It does this by checking that there are no conflicts between any of the queens on the board.

The `Print_Board` procedure prints the chessboard to the console.

The `N_Queens_Core` function is the recursive core of the N-queens solver. It tries to place queens on the chessboard one row at a time. If it can find a solution where all queens are placed without any conflicts, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The `N_Queens` procedure calls the `N_Queens_Core` function to solve the N-queens problem. If a solution is found, it prints the solution to the console. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating that no solution was found.
