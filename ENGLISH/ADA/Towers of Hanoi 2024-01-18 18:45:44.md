This code implements the Towers of Hanoi puzzle in Ada. The puzzle consists of three towers and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one tower, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The goal of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another tower, obeying the following simple rules:

* Only one disk can be moved at a time.
* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
* No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

With 3 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 7 moves. The general solution for `n` disks is `2^n - 1`.

The code first defines a type `Disk_Size` to represent the size of a disk. It then defines a type `Tower` to represent a tower of disks. A tower is an array of disk sizes, with the bottom of the tower at index 1 and the top of the tower at the last index.

The code then defines a type `Move` to represent a move of a disk from one tower to another. A move consists of the `From` and `To` towers, and the `Size` of the disk being moved.

The code then defines a function `Create_Tower` to create a new tower of a given size. The function takes the size of the tower as a parameter and returns a tower array with the disks in ascending order of size, starting at the bottom of the tower.

The code then defines a procedure `Move_Disk` to move a disk from one tower to another. The procedure takes the `From` and `To` towers and the `Size` of the disk being moved as parameters. The procedure finds the disk of the given size on the `From` tower and moves it to the `To` tower.

The code then defines a procedure `Print_Towers` to print the current state of the towers. The procedure takes an array of three towers as a parameter and prints the disks on each tower.

The code then defines a procedure `Towers_of_Hanoi` to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle for a given number of disks. The procedure takes the number of disks as a parameter and uses the `Create_Tower`, `Move_Disk`, and `Print_Towers` procedures to solve the puzzle.

The `main` procedure of the program calls the `Towers_of_Hanoi` procedure with 8 disks to solve the puzzle.
