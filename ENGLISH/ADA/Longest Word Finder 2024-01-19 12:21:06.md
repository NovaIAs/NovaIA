Explanation:

* The program first creates an array called `Histogram` that has 256 elements, one for each possible character in the ASCII character set.
* Then, it iterates over all the characters in the ASCII character set and increments the corresponding element in the `Histogram` array.
* After that, it iterates over the letters in the alphabet and finds the letter that occurs most frequently in the text.
* Finally, it prints the letter that occurs most frequently in the text.

This program is complex because it uses a number of different concepts in Ada, including arrays, loops, and conditional statements. It is also a good example of how Ada can be used to solve problems in a clear and concise way.
