This code implements a binary search tree in Ada. A binary search tree is a data structure that stores data in a way that allows for efficient searching and retrieval. The code includes a procedure for inserting a new value into the tree, and a procedure for printing the values in the tree in ascending order.

The code begins by defining a record type called `Tree_Node`. This record type represents a node in the binary search tree. Each node has three fields: `Value`, `Left`, and `Right`. The `Value` field stores the value of the node, the `Left` field stores a pointer to the left child of the node, and the `Right` field stores a pointer to the right child of the node.

The code then defines a type called `Tree` which is an access type to `Tree_Node`. This type represents a binary search tree. A binary search tree is a collection of nodes that are connected together by pointers. The root node of the tree is the first node in the tree, and the left and right children of a node are the nodes that are connected to the node by the `Left` and `Right` fields, respectively.

The code then defines a procedure called `Insert`. This procedure takes two parameters: `Node` and `Value`. The `Node` parameter is an in out parameter, which means that it can be both read from and written to. The `Value` parameter is an in parameter, which means that it can only be read from. The `Insert` procedure inserts the value of the `Value` parameter into the binary search tree represented by the `Node` parameter.

The `Insert` procedure works by recursively traversing the binary search tree. If the `Node` parameter is null, then the procedure creates a new node with the value of the `Value` parameter and sets the `Left` and `Right` fields of the new node to null. If the `Node` parameter is not null, then the procedure compares the value of the `Value` parameter to the value of the `Node` parameter. If the value of the `Value` parameter is less than the value of the `Node` parameter, then the procedure calls itself recursively on the `Left` field of the `Node` parameter. If the value of the `Value` parameter is greater than or equal to the value of the `Node` parameter, then the procedure calls itself recursively on the `Right` field of the `Node` parameter.

The code then defines a procedure called `Print`. This procedure takes one parameter: `Node`. The `Node` parameter is an in parameter, which means that it can only be read from. The `Print` procedure prints the values in the binary search tree represented by the `Node` parameter in ascending order.

The `Print` procedure works by recursively traversing the binary search tree. If the `Node` parameter is null, then the procedure does nothing. If the `Node` parameter is not null, then the procedure calls itself recursively on the `Left` field of the `Node` parameter. The procedure then prints the value of the `Node` parameter. Finally, the procedure calls itself recursively on the `Right` field of the `Node` parameter.

The code then creates a binary search tree and inserts the values 10, 5, 15, 3, 7, 12, and 20 into the tree. The code then calls the `Print` procedure to print the values in the tree in ascending order. The output of the program is:
