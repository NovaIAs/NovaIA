This code prints the first 20 Fibonacci numbers.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1, and the rest of the sequence is generated by adding the two previous numbers together.

The code uses a subtype called Index to represent the index of the Fibonacci number that we want to calculate. The type State is a record that stores the current and next Fibonacci numbers.

The function Fibonacci takes an index as an input and returns the Fibonacci number at that index. The function uses a loop to calculate the Fibonacci numbers. In each iteration of the loop, the current and next Fibonacci numbers are updated.

The main program uses a loop to print the first 20 Fibonacci numbers. The function Fibonacci is called to calculate each Fibonacci number, and the result is printed to the console.
