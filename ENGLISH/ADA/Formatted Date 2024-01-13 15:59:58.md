This code is a procedure that formats a date and prints it to the console. The procedure uses the Ada.Calendar.Formatting package to format the date, and the Ada.Text_IO package to print the date to the console.

The procedure first defines a constant string that contains the format string for the date. The format string specifies the order of the date components (year, month, and day) and the separators between the components.

Next, the procedure uses the Put procedure from the Ada.Text_IO package to print the format string to the console. The Put procedure takes a string as an argument and prints it to the console.

After printing the format string, the procedure uses the Put procedure again to print the year, month, and day components of the date to the console. The Put procedure takes an integer as an argument and prints it to the console. The procedure uses the Year, Month, and Day functions from the Ada.Calendar.Formatting package to get the year, month, and day components of the date.

Finally, the procedure uses the New_Line procedure from the Ada.Text_IO package to print a new line to the console. The New_Line procedure prints a new line to the console.
