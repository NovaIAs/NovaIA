The provided code is a program written in the Ada programming language that generates cyclic shifts of input strings. A cyclic shift is a rotation of the characters in a string, where the first character becomes the last and the rest of the characters move one position to the left. The program performs the following tasks:

1. It defines a function called `Rotate_Left`, which takes an unbounded string as input and returns a new string that is the cyclic shift of the input string. This function shifts all characters in the input string one position to the left, causing the first character to become the last.

2. It declares a package called `Integer_IO`, which is an instantiation of the generic package `Ada.Integer_Text_IO` for the type `Integer`. This package provides formatted input and output operations for integers.

3. The program defines a procedure named `Do_Cyclic_Shift`, which takes an unbounded string as input. This procedure uses the `Rotate_Left` function to generate and print all possible cyclic shifts of the input string.

4. In the main program, it calls the `Do_Cyclic_Shift` procedure for three different input strings: "ABC", "123456", and "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ". This prints all cyclic shifts of these strings to the console.

Here's an example of the output generated by the program:

```
ABC BCA CAB
123456 234561 345612 456123 561234 612345
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY CD
```

This program demonstrates the use of functions, packages, and loops in Ada to perform string manipulation and formatted input/output.
