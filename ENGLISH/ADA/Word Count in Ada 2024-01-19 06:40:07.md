This Ada program counts the number of occurrences of each word in a text file. It uses a map data structure to store the word counts. The program first prompts the user to enter the name of the text file. It then opens the file and reads each line of the file. For each line, it tokenizes the line into words and adds each word to the map. If the word is already in the map, the program increments its count. Otherwise, the program adds the word to the map with a count of 1.

After processing all the lines in the file, the program sorts the words in the map by their counts in descending order. It then prints the sorted list of words and their counts to the console.

Here is a breakdown of the key parts of the program:

* The `String_Map` type is a map that maps strings to natural numbers. This type is used to store the word counts.
* The `Process_File` procedure takes a file name as input and processes the file. It reads each line of the file, tokenizes the line into words, and adds each word to the map.
* The `Print_Results` procedure takes a map as input and prints the sorted list of words and their counts to the console.
* The `Array_Of_Words` array is used to store the sorted list of words.
* The `Sort_Strings` procedure sorts the array of words in descending order.
* The `Reverse` parameter of the `Sort_Strings` procedure tells the procedure to sort the array in reverse order.

This program is complex and differentiated because it uses a number of advanced Ada features, including generics, maps, and sorting. It is also a practical program that can be used to count the number of occurrences of words in a text file.
