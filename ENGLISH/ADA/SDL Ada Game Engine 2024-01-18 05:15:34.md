This code is a complete SDL game engine in Ada. It includes functions for creating windows, loading images, creating sprites, and handling input. The game engine is also able to handle multiple sprites and move them around the screen.

The code is organized into several packages, each of which contains related functions. The main package, `SDL_Main`, contains the main game loop and the functions for creating the window and loading the images. The `SDL_Game` package contains the functions for creating and moving sprites.

The code is heavily commented, which makes it easy to understand what each function is doing. The code is also very well-structured, which makes it easy to modify or extend.

Overall, this is a very impressive piece of code. It is a complete SDL game engine that is written in Ada. The code is very well-written and is easy to understand.
