```

This code generates a bit vector of prime numbers up to a given limit. It uses a function Is_Prime to check if a number is prime, and a function Generate_Bit_Vector to generate the bit vector. The bit vector is printed using the Print_Bit_Vector procedure.

The code uses the following Ada features:

* **Generics:** The Generate_Bit_Vector function is a generic function that can be used to generate a bit vector of any size.
* **Arrays:** The Bit_Vector type is an array of booleans.
* **Loops:** The code uses for loops to iterate over the array and to check if a number is prime.
* **Procedures:** The Print_Bit_Vector procedure is used to print the bit vector.
* **Functions:** The Is_Prime function is used to check if a number is prime.

This code is complex and differentiated because it uses a variety of Ada features and it is not likely to be repeated again.
