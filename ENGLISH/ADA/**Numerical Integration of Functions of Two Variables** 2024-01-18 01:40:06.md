This code is a complex and differentiated Ada program that calculates the integral of a function of two variables over a specified line segment. The function to be integrated can be either a parabola or a spiral, and the line segment is defined by its endpoints. The program uses a numerical integration method called the trapezoidal rule.

The program is structured as follows:

* The `Point` subtype is defined as an array of two floats, representing a point in two-dimensional space.
* The `Function` subtype is defined as a pointer to a procedure that takes a point and returns a float. This allows the program to be used with different functions without having to change the code.
* The `Integrate` procedure takes a function and a line segment as input, and returns the integral of the function over the line segment.
* The `Parabola` and `Spiral` functions are defined as procedures that take a point and return a float. These functions define the two different functions that can be integrated.
* The main program takes a command-line argument that specifies which function to integrate. It then calls the `Integrate` procedure to calculate the integral and prints the result.

The program uses the `Ada.Command_Line` package to get the command-line arguments, the `Ada.Numerics.Float_Operations` package to perform floating-point operations, the `Ada.Numerics.Elementary_Functions` package to perform elementary mathematical functions, and the `Ada.Real_Time` package to measure the elapsed time.

The program is complex because it uses a variety of Ada features, including subtyping, pointers, and procedures. It is also differentiated because it can be used with different functions without having to change the code. The program is also efficient because it uses a numerical integration method that is known to be accurate and efficient.
