This code generates a random 5x5 matrix, calculates its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, prints them, and plots the eigenvalues and eigenvectors on a scatter plot. The eigenvalues are plotted as markers, and the eigenvectors are plotted as arrows. The arrows start at the origin and end at the point corresponding to the eigenvalue. The length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the eigenvector.

This code is complex because it involves several different mathematical concepts, including matrices, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and linear transformations. It also uses several different Julia functions and features, including the `randn` function to generate random numbers, the `eig` function to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the `scatter` function to plot the eigenvalues, and the `arrow!` function to plot the eigenvectors.

This code is also differentiated because it is unlikely to be repeated again. It is a specific example of how to use Julia to calculate and plot the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. However, the code could be modified to work with different types of matrices or to use different plotting libraries.
