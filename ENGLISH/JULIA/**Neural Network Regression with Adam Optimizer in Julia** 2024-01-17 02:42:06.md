Sure! Here's a complex and differentiated code in Julia:

```julia
# Import necessary libraries
using LinearAlgebra, Plots, Optim, Random

# Define a non-linear function
f(x) = 0.5 * x^3 - 2 * x^2 + 3 * x - 1

# Generate random data for training
n = 100
x_train = rand(n, 1)
y_train = f(x_train) + 0.1 * randn(n, 1)

# Define a neural network model with 3 layers
model = Chain(
    Dense(1, 10, relu),
    Dense(10, 10, relu),
    Dense(10, 1)
)

# Define the loss function and optimizer
loss(y_pred, y_true) = mean((y_pred - y_true)^2)
optimizer = Adam(0.01)

# Train the model for 1000 epochs
for epoch in 1:1000
    for i in 1:n
        y_pred = model(x_train[i])
        loss_val = loss(y_pred, y_train[i])
        optimizer.update!(model, -gradient(loss_val, model))
    end
    println("Epoch $epoch, Loss: $(loss_val)")
end

# Test the model on new data
x_test = rand(50, 1)
y_pred = model.(x_test)

# Plot the results
plot(x_test, y_pred, label="Predicted")
plot!(x_test, f(x_test), label="Actual")
```

**Explanation:**

1. We start by importing necessary libraries.

2. We define a non-linear function `f(x)` as an example of a complex function.

3. We generate random data for training the neural network model.

4. We define a neural network model with 3 layers, where each layer has 10 neurons and uses the ReLU activation function.

5. We define the loss function as the mean squared error and the optimizer as Adam with a learning rate of 0.01.

6. We train the model for 1000 epochs, where each epoch consists of iterating over the entire training data and updating the model's parameters using the optimizer.

7. We print the loss value after each epoch to monitor the training progress.

8. Finally, we test the model on new data and plot the predicted values along with the actual values to visualize the model's performance.

This code is complex because it involves multiple layers of neural networks, training with an optimizer, and evaluating the model's performance. It is also differentiated because it uses the Adam optimizer, which is an advanced optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter. Additionally, the code is not likely to be repeated again because it is specific to the given problem and dataset.
