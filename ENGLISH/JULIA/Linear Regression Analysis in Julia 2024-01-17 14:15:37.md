This code performs a linear regression analysis on a given dataset. It starts by loading the data from a CSV file, then creates a scatter plot of the data. Next, it fits a linear regression model to the data and plots the fitted line. The code then calculates the residuals, which are the differences between the observed data points and the predicted values from the model. The code then plots the residuals and calculates the mean absolute error, which is a measure of the accuracy of the model. Finally, the code prints the mean absolute error to the console.
