This code defines a series of functions to perform various statistical calculations on a list of numbers. The functions include:

* `factorial(n)`: Calculates the factorial of a number.
* `sum(list)`: Calculates the sum of a list of numbers.
* `average(list)`: Calculates the average of a list of numbers.
* `median(list)`: Calculates the median of a list of numbers.
* `mode(list)`: Calculates the mode of a list of numbers.
* `range(list)`: Calculates the range of a list of numbers.
* `variance(list)`: Calculates the variance of a list of numbers.
* `standard_deviation(list)`: Calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers.

These functions can be used to perform a variety of statistical calculations on data. For example, you could use these functions to calculate the average and standard deviation of a set of test scores.
