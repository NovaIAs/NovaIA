Here is a complex and differentiated code in Julia that solves a system of nonlinear equations using the Newton-Raphson method:

```julia
using LinearAlgebra

function newton_raphson(f, Df, x0, tol, max_iter)
    # Initialize the iteration counter and the error
    iter = 0
    error = norm(f(x0))

    # Iterate until the error is below the tolerance or the maximum number of iterations is reached
    while error > tol && iter < max_iter
        # Calculate the Jacobian matrix at the current point
        J = Df(x0)

        # Solve the linear system to find the update vector
        delta_x = -J \ f(x0)

        # Update the current point
        x0 = x0 + delta_x

        # Calculate the new error
        error = norm(f(x0))

        # Increment the iteration counter
        iter += 1
    end

    # Return the final solution and the number of iterations
    return x0, iter
end

# Define the system of nonlinear equations
f(x) = [x[1] - x[2], x[1]^2 + x[2]^2 - 1]

# Define the Jacobian matrix
Df(x) = [1, -1; 2*x[1], 2*x[2]]

# Set the initial guess, tolerance, and maximum number of iterations
x0 = [0.5, 0.5]
tol = 1e-6
max_iter = 100

# Solve the system of equations
solution, iterations = newton_raphson(f, Df, x0, tol, max_iter)

# Print the solution and the number of iterations
println("Solution: $solution")
println("Number of iterations: $iterations")
```

This code uses the Newton-Raphson method to solve a system of two nonlinear equations. The system of equations is defined by the function `f`, and the Jacobian matrix is defined by the function `Df`. The initial guess is set to `x0`, the tolerance is set to `tol`, and the maximum number of iterations is set to `max_iter`. The `newton_raphson` function then iteratively updates the current point until the error is below the tolerance or the maximum number of iterations is reached. The final solution and the number of iterations are then printed to the console.
