This code solves a system of two coupled differential equations using the DifferentialEquations.jl package. The differential equations are defined in the `diff_eq!` function, which takes the state vector `u`, the time `t`, and the parameters `params` as input, and returns the derivatives of `u` with respect to `t`. The initial conditions are set in the `u0` variable, and the parameters are set in the `params` variable. The `solve` function is used to solve the differential equation system, and the solution is stored in the `sol` variable. Finally, the `plot` function is used to plot the solution.

The differential equations in this code represent a simple predator-prey model, where `u[1]` is the population of prey and `u[2]` is the population of predators. The parameters `α`, `β`, and `γ` represent the rate of growth of the prey, the rate of predation, and the rate of death of the predators, respectively.

The solution to the differential equation system shows that the populations of prey and predators oscillate over time. This is because the prey population grows when the predator population is low, and the predator population grows when the prey population is high. However, when the predator population gets too high, it starts to deplete the prey population, which causes the predator population to decline. This in turn allows the prey population to recover, and the cycle repeats.

This code is a good example of how to use the DifferentialEquations.jl package to solve systems of differential equations. It also demonstrates how to plot the solution to a differential equation system.
