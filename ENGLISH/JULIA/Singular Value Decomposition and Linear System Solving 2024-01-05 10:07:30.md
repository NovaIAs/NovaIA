This code generates a random matrix **A** and a random vector **b**, then computes the singular value decomposition of **A**, the pseudoinverse of **A**, and solves the linear system of equations **A * x = b**. It then computes the residual vector **r = b - A * x** and prints the norm of the residual vector.

The code uses several functions from the **LinearAlgebra** package to perform the necessary matrix operations. The **svd** function computes the singular value decomposition of a matrix, the **pseudoinverse** function computes the pseudoinverse of a matrix, the **solve** function solves a linear system of equations, and the **norm** function computes the norm of a vector.

The code also uses several functions from the **Random** package to generate random matrices and vectors. The **rand_matrix** function generates a random matrix of a given size, and the **rand** function generates a random vector of a given size.

The code is well-commented and easy to understand. It is also efficient and uses the appropriate functions from the **LinearAlgebra** and **Random** packages to perform the necessary operations.
