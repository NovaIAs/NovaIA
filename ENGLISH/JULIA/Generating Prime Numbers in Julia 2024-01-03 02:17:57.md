Certainly! Here's a complex and differentiated code in Julia:

```julia
# Function to check if a number is prime
function is_prime(n)
    if n <= 1
        return false
    end
    
    for i in 2:isqrt(n)
        if n % i == 0
            return false
        end
    end
    
    return true
end

# Function to generate a sequence of prime numbers
function generate_prime_sequence(n)
    primes = []
    current_num = 2
    
    while length(primes) < n
        if is_prime(current_num)
            push!(primes, current_num)
        end
        
        current_num += 1
    end
    
    return primes
end

# Example usage
sequence_length = 10
primes_sequence = generate_prime_sequence(sequence_length)

println("The first $sequence_length prime numbers are:")
println(primes_sequence)
```

This code contains two functions written in Julia.

The first function, `is_prime(n)`, takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it is a prime number. It starts by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it immediately returns `false`. Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by any of the numbers in that range. If it finds a divisor, it returns `false`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, it means `n` is prime, and the function returns `true`.

The second function, `generate_prime_sequence(n)`, generates a sequence of prime numbers of length `n`. It starts with an empty array `primes` and a variable `current_num` set to 2. It enters a while loop that continues until the length of `primes` is equal to `n`. Inside the loop, it calls the `is_prime` function to check if `current_num` is prime. If it is, `current_num` is added to the `primes` array using the `push!` function. Finally, `current_num` is incremented by 1, and the loop repeats. Once the loop exits, the function returns the `primes` array.

In the example usage section, the code sets `sequence_length` to 10 and calls the `generate_prime_sequence` function with this value. It then prints out the generated prime sequence using `println`.

This code generates the first `n` prime numbers and demonstrates the usage of functions and arrays in Julia.
