This code contains a collection of useful mathematical and statistical functions in Julia, including Fibonacci number calculation, finding minimum and maximum values, calculating average, standard deviation, variance, covariance, and correlation coefficient. It also includes functions for linear regression, such as fitting a model, making predictions, and evaluating the model's performance using mean absolute error and root mean squared error. Finally, there's a function to plot a scatter plot with a linear regression line. These functions offer a wide range of capabilities for data analysis and modeling in Julia.
