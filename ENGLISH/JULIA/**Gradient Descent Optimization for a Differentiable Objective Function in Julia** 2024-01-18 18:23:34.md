This code demonstrates a complex and differentiated optimization problem in Julia.

The code begins by importing the necessary libraries, including LinearAlgebra, Plots, and Random.

Next, the objective function, f(x), is defined. This function is a combination of a quadratic term and a cosine term. It represents the function that we want to minimize.

Following this, the gradient of the objective function, df(x), is defined. This is the derivative of the objective function, which provides information about its slope at any given point.

The optimization parameters are then initialized. This includes the initial guess for the solution (x0), the maximum number of iterations (niter), and the learning rate (alpha).

The optimization loop is then started. In each iteration, the gradient at the current point is calculated, and the solution is updated using gradient descent. The update rule subtracts a fraction (determined by the learning rate) of the gradient from the current solution.

The optimization loop continues until the stopping criterion is met. In this case, the stopping criterion is that the norm of the gradient is less than a certain threshold.

Once the optimization is complete, the final solution (x0) is printed.

Finally, the code plots the objective function and the solution. This allows us to visualize the problem and the result of the optimization.

This code showcases a complex and differentiated optimization problem in Julia, demonstrating the use of gradient descent for finding the optimal solution. It combines mathematical concepts, numerical methods, and data visualization, making it an example of a comprehensive and versatile optimization script.
