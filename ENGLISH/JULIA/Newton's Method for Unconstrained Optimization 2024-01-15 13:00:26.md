This code solves an unconstrained optimization problem using Newton's method. The objective function is a quadratic function, and the gradient and Hessian of the objective function are also quadratic functions. The code uses the `optimize` function from the `Optim` package to solve the optimization problem. The `optimize` function takes the objective function, the gradient of the objective function, the Hessian of the objective function, and an initial guess as input, and returns the optimal solution as output.

The code also plots the objective function, the gradient of the objective function, and the Hessian of the objective function. This allows us to visualize the optimization problem and see how the solution changes as we move along the gradient.
