Explanation:

This code demonstrates a complex optimization task in Julia, covering the optimization of a multi-dimensional objective function using the BFGS algorithm. Here's how it works:

1. **Importing Libraries**:
   - `using LinearAlgebra, Plots, Optimization, Calculus`: This line loads the necessary libraries for linear algebra, plotting, optimization, and calculus, which are required for the optimization and visualization tasks.

2. **Defining the Objective Function**:
   - `objective(x) = sum(x.^2) - 10 * sum(x)`: This function defines the objective function to be minimized. It calculates the sum of squared elements in the input vector `x` and subtracts 10 times the sum of the elements in `x`.

3. **Defining the Gradient**:
   - `gradient(x) = 2 * x - 10`: This function computes the gradient of the objective function. It returns a vector with the partial derivatives of the objective function with respect to each element of `x`.

4. **Defining the Hessian Matrix**:
   - `hessian(x) = 2 * eye(length(x))`: This function calculates the Hessian matrix of the objective function, which is a matrix of second partial derivatives. In this case, the Hessian matrix is a diagonal matrix with all diagonal elements equal to 2.

5. **Initial Guess**:
   - `x0 = randn(10)`: This line generates a random vector of length 10 as the initial guess for the optimization algorithm.

6. **Optimizing the Objective Function**:
   - `result = optimize(objective, gradient, hessian, x0)`: This line uses the BFGS algorithm to minimize the objective function. It takes the objective function, gradient, Hessian matrix, and initial guess as inputs and returns the result of the optimization.

7. **Plotting the Objective Function, Gradient, and Hessian Matrix**:
   - `plot(x, objective(x), label="Objective Function")`, `plot!(x, gradient(x), label="Gradient")`, `plot!(x, hessian(x), label="Hessian")`: These lines generate plots for the objective function, its gradient, and the Hessian matrix. They are plotted with respect to the input vector `x`.

8. **Displaying the Optimization Results**:
   - `println("Optimal Solution: ", result.x)`, `println("Optimal Value: ", result.fval)`: These lines display the optimal solution vector and the corresponding optimal value of the objective function.

This code serves as a comprehensive example of a complex optimization task in Julia, combining the use of optimization algorithms, plotting, and calculus to understand and solve a multi-dimensional optimization problem.
