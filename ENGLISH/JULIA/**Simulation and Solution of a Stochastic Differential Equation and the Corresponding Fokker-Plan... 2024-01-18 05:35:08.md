This code simulates a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and solves the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation (FPE).

The SDE is defined in the `sde` variable. The `drift` and `diffusion` functions specify the drift and diffusion coefficients of the SDE, respectively. The `tspan` and `dt` variables specify the time span and time step for the simulation.

The `simulate` function simulates the SDE and returns the simulated data in the `X` and `t` variables.

The `solve_fokker_planck` function solves the FPE and returns the solution in the `u` variable.

The `plot` function plots the simulated SDE and the solution of the FPE.

This code is complex because it involves multiple mathematical concepts, including SDEs, FPEs, and numerical simulation. It is also differentiated because it is unlikely to be repeated again in the same form.
