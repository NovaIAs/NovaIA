This code generates a random matrix `A` of size 1000x1000, calculates the singular value decomposition (SVD) of `A`, and plots the singular values of `A`. It then extracts the top 10 singular values and corresponding singular vectors, and uses these to reconstruct the matrix `A`. Finally, it calculates the error between the original matrix `A` and the reconstructed matrix `A_reconstructed`, and prints the error.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

* The `using` statement imports the `LinearAlgebra` and `Plots` modules, which are used for matrix operations and plotting, respectively.
* The `rand_matrix` function is defined to generate a random matrix of a given size.
* The `svd` function is defined to calculate the SVD of a matrix. The SVD of a matrix `A` is a decomposition of the form `A = U * S * V'`, where `U` and `V` are unitary matrices and `S` is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of `A`.
* The `plot_singular_values` function is defined to plot the singular values of a matrix.
* The `A` variable is assigned a random matrix of size 1000x1000 using the `rand_matrix` function.
* The SVD of `A` is calculated using the `svd` function, and the results are stored in the variables `U`, `S`, and `V`.
* The `plot_singular_values` function is called to plot the singular values of `A`.
* The `top_10_singular_values` variable is assigned the top 10 singular values of `A`, which are the first 10 elements of the diagonal matrix `S`.
* The `top_10_left_singular_vectors` variable is assigned the top 10 left singular vectors of `A`, which are the first 10 columns of the unitary matrix `U`.
* The `top_10_right_singular_vectors` variable is assigned the top 10 right singular vectors of `A`, which are the first 10 columns of the unitary matrix `V`.
* The `A_reconstructed` variable is assigned the matrix that is reconstructed using the top 10 singular values and singular vectors. This is done by multiplying the top 10 left singular vectors by the diagonal matrix of top 10 singular values, and then multiplying the result by the transpose of the top 10 right singular vectors.
* The `error` variable is assigned the error between the original matrix `A` and the reconstructed matrix `A_reconstructed`. This is calculated by taking the 2-norm of the difference between the two matrices.
* The `println` statement prints the error to the console.
