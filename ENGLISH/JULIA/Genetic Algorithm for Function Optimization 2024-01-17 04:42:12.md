This code implements a genetic algorithm to optimize a function. The genetic algorithm is a search algorithm that is inspired by the process of natural selection. The algorithm starts with a population of random individuals, and then iteratively evolves the population by selecting the fittest individuals and allowing them to reproduce. The algorithm terminates when a certain number of generations have been reached, or when a satisfactory solution has been found.

The code first defines the function to be optimized, `f(x)`. The function is a quadratic function, and the goal is to find the value of `x` that minimizes the function.

Next, the code defines the genetic algorithm parameters. These parameters include the population size, the number of generations, the crossover rate, and the mutation rate. The population size is the number of individuals in the population, the number of generations is the number of times the population is evolved, the crossover rate is the probability that two individuals will crossover to create a new individual, and the mutation rate is the probability that an individual will be mutated.

The code then initializes the population with a population of random individuals. The individuals are represented as arrays of real numbers.

The code then runs the genetic algorithm for the specified number of generations. In each generation, the code evaluates the fitness of each individual in the population, selects the fittest individuals as parents, crossovers the parents to create new individuals, mutates the children, and adds the children to the population. The population is then sorted by fitness, and the top individuals are kept for the next generation.

Finally, the code prints the best individual in the population. The best individual is the individual with the highest fitness.
