Explanation:

* The code first defines a function `hamming_distance` that computes the Hamming distance between two binary strings. The Hamming distance is the number of positions at which the two strings differ.
* The code then generates all possible binary strings of length `n` using the `product` and `join` functions.
* The code then computes the Hamming distance matrix for all pairs of binary strings using a nested loop.
* The code then finds the minimum Hamming distance among all pairs of binary strings using the `minimum` function.
* The code then finds all pairs of binary strings that achieve the minimum Hamming distance using the `filter` function.
* Finally, the code prints the results.
