using Plots, MandelbrotSets

# We define the size of the image we want to generate.
width = 1024
height = 768

# We create a matrix to store the pixel values of the image.
image = zeros(ComplexF64, width, height)

# We define the range of complex numbers we want to iterate over.
xmin = -2.0
xmax = 1.0
ymin = -1.0i
ymax = 1.0i

# We iterate over each pixel in the image.
for x in 1:width
    for y in 1:height
        # We calculate the complex number corresponding to the pixel.
        c = xmin + (xmax - xmin) * (x - 1) / (width - 1) + ymin + (ymax - ymin) * (y - 1) / (height - 1)

        # We calculate the number of iterations it takes for the complex number to escape the Mandelbrot set.
        iterations = mandelbrot_iterations(c, 256)

        # We store the number of iterations in the pixel value matrix.
        image[x, y] = iterations
    end
end

# We plot the image.
Plots.heatmap(image, xlabel="Real", ylabel="Imaginary", title="Mandelbrot Set")

```

This code is large and differentiated because it performs a complex calculation (generating a Mandelbrot set fractal image) and uses multiple libraries and functions.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The first few lines import the necessary libraries and define the size of the image we want to generate.
* The next few lines define the range of complex numbers we want to iterate over.
* The main part of the code is a loop that iterates over each pixel in the image. For each pixel, we calculate the complex number corresponding to the pixel and the number of iterations it takes for the complex number to escape the Mandelbrot set. We then store the number of iterations in the pixel value matrix.
* The final few lines plot the image using the Plots library.

This code is a good example of how Julia can be used to perform complex calculations and generate beautiful graphics.
