Sure! Here's a complex Julia code that utilizes advanced mathematical concepts, such as fractals and complex numbers. It generates a Mandelbrot set visualization using the Julia programming language.

```julia
using Images

function mandelbrot(width, height, zoom, max_iter)
    img = ImageBuffer{RGB}(width, height)
    center_x = -0.5
    center_y = 0.0

    for x in 1:width
        for y in 1:height
            zx = (x - width / 2.0) * zoom / width + center_x
            zy = (y - height / 2.0) * zoom / height + center_y

            c = zx + zy * im
            z = c

            iter = 0
            while abs(z) <= 2.0 && iter < max_iter
                z = z^2 + c
                iter += 1
            end

            if iter == max_iter
                img[x, y] = RGB{N0f8}(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
            else
                log_iter = log(iter)

                smooth_iter = iter + 1 - log(log_iter) / log(2)
                hue = smooth_iter / max_iter
                img[x, y] = HSV(hue, 1.0, 1.0)
            end
        end
    end

    img
end

width = 800
height = 600
zoom = 1.0
max_iter = 1000

img = mandelbrot(width, height, zoom, max_iter)
save("mandelbrot.png", img)
```

Explanation:
1. The code starts by importing the Images package, which allows us to create and manipulate images.
2. The `mandelbrot` function takes four arguments: `width` and `height` define the dimensions of the resulting image, `zoom` controls the zoom level of the fractal, and `max_iter` determines the maximum number of iterations.
3. Inside the `mandelbrot` function, an image buffer is created using `ImageBuffer{RGB}(width, height)`, which will store the resulting image.
4. The function then iterates over each pixel in the image, mapping its coordinates to the complex plane.
5. For each pixel, it performs the Mandelbrot set iteration, checking if the complex number `z` stays within a certain threshold and the maximum number of iterations hasn't been exceeded.
6. If the maximum number of iterations is reached, the pixel is set to black; otherwise, the pixel's color is determined based on the smooth iteration count.
7. Finally, the resulting image is saved to a file named "mandelbrot.png" using the `save` function.

This code generates a beautiful visualization of the Mandelbrot set, a famous fractal in mathematics. The resulting image will be saved as "mandelbrot.png". The parameters `width`, `height`, `zoom`, and `max_iter` can be adjusted to create different variations of the Mandelbrot set.
