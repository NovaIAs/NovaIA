Explanation:

1. We define a complex function `f(x)` to differentiate. It involves the exponential, sine, and power functions.

2. We use the `gradient` function from the Julia DifferentialEquations package to automatically compute the gradient of `f(x)`. This gradient is a function that returns the partial derivatives of `f(x)` with respect to `x`.

3. We define a complex objective function `objective(x)` to optimize. It involves a quadratic term and a cubic term.

4. We again use the `gradient` function to automatically compute the gradient of the `objective` function.

5. We perform gradient descent to minimize the `objective` function. We start with an initial guess `x0` and iteratively update `x0` by subtracting a fraction (determined by the `learning_rate`) of the gradient from `x0`.

6. We print the optimized value of `x` after 100 iterations of gradient descent.

This code demonstrates complex function differentiation, automatic differentiation, and optimization using gradient descent in Julia. It's a more advanced example that showcases the capabilities of Julia for scientific computing and machine learning tasks.
