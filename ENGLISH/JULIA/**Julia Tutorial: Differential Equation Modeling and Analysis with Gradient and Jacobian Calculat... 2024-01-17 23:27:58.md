This code demonstrates a more complex and differentiated use of the Julia language. It imports several libraries for data analysis, plotting, and differential equations.

The code first loads a CSV file containing data, creates an ODE model, sets initial conditions, and solves the ODE. The results are then plotted.

Next, the code defines a function to calculate the gradient of the model and calculates the gradient at different points in time.

Finally, the code defines a function to calculate the Jacobian of the model and calculates the Jacobian at different points in time.

This code demonstrates the use of Julia for complex scientific and mathematical modeling and analysis. It shows how to load data, create a model, solve it, and analyze the results using gradients and Jacobians.
