**Explanation:**

This code solves a differential equation system using the DifferentialEquations.jl library in Julia. The system describes the motion of a mass attached to a spring and subject to a control force.

The differential equation system is defined by the `dxdt` function, which takes the current state of the system `x`, the control input `u`, and the time `t` as inputs, and returns the rate of change of the state. In this case, the state of the system is the position and velocity of the mass, and the control input is the force applied to the mass.

The initial conditions for the system are defined by the `x0` variable, which is a vector containing the initial position and velocity of the mass.

The time span over which the system is to be solved is defined by the `t_span` variable, which is a tuple containing the start time and end time.

The control function `u` is defined as a constant force of 1.0.

The differential equation system is solved using the `solve` function, which takes the `dxdt` function, the initial conditions `x0`, the time span `t_span`, and the control function `u` as inputs, and returns a `Solution` object containing the solution to the system.

The solution is then plotted using the Plots.jl library. The `plot` function is used to plot the position and velocity of the mass over time. The `show` function is used to display the plot.
