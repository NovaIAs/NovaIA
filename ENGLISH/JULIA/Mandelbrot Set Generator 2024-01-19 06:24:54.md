This code generates a Mandelbrot set image. The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers with a fractal boundary that has been described as "the most complex object in mathematics". The code first defines a function to calculate the Mandelbrot set for a given complex number and a maximum number of iterations. It then creates a complex plane by defining the minimum and maximum values for the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers, and the width and height of the image. The code then calculates the Mandelbrot set for each pixel in the complex plane, and stores the number of iterations it took for each pixel to escape the set in a matrix. Finally, the code saves the image to a file and plots it.
