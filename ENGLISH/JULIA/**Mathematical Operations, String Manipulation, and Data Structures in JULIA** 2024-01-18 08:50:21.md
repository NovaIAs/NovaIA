# This Julia code demonstrates a complex and differentiated computation, involving various mathematical operations, string manipulation, and data structures.

# Define a custom function for calculating the factorial of a number
factorial(n) = reduce(*, [1:n])

# Define a function that takes a string and returns a list of its unique characters
unique_chars(s) = sort(Set(s))

# Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10
nums = 1:10

# Calculate the factorial of each number in the list and store the results in a new list
factorials = map(factorial, nums)

# Create a string containing the digits from 0 to 9
digits = "0123456789"

# Create a list of all possible 4-digit numbers using the digits string
four_digit_numbers = permutations(digits, 4)

# Filter the list of 4-digit numbers to include only those that contain the digit '5'
four_digit_numbers_with_5 = filter(x -> x[1] == '5', four_digit_numbers)

# Create a dictionary to store the count of unique characters in each 4-digit number
unique_char_counts = Dict()

# Iterate over the list of 4-digit numbers and calculate the count of unique characters in each number
for num in four_digit_numbers_with_5
    unique_char_counts[num] = length(unique_chars(num))
end

# Get the maximum count of unique characters among all 4-digit numbers
max_unique_char_count = maximum(unique_char_counts.values)

# Filter the dictionary to include only those numbers with the maximum count of unique characters
max_unique_char_numbers = filter(x -> x[2] == max_unique_char_count, unique_char_counts)

# Print the numbers with the maximum count of unique characters
for num, count in max_unique_char_numbers
    println("$num has $count unique characters")
end

# Print the factorial of the maximum count of unique characters
println("Factorial of $max_unique_char_count is $(factorial(max_unique_char_count))")

**Explanation:**

1. **Custom Function**: A function `factorial` is defined to calculate the factorial of a number using the `reduce` function.

2. **Unique Characters**: The `unique_chars` function takes a string and returns a list of its unique characters using `Set` and `sort` functions.

3. **List of Numbers**: A list of numbers from 1 to 10 is created using `1:10`.

4. **Factorial of Numbers**: The `map` function is used to apply the `factorial` function to each number in the list, resulting in a list of factorials.

5. **4-Digit Numbers**: All possible 4-digit numbers using the digits from 0 to 9 are generated using `permutations`.

6. **Filter 4-Digit Numbers**: The `filter` function is used to select only those 4-digit numbers that contain the digit '5'.

7. **Unique Character Counts**: A dictionary is created to store the count of unique characters in each 4-digit number.

8. **Maximum Count**: The `maximum` function is used to find the maximum count of unique characters among all 4-digit numbers.

9. **Filter Numbers with Maximum Count**: The dictionary is filtered to include only those numbers with the maximum count of unique characters.

10. **Output**: The numbers with the maximum count of unique characters are printed.

11. **Factorial of Maximum Count**: The factorial of the maximum count of unique characters is calculated and printed.
