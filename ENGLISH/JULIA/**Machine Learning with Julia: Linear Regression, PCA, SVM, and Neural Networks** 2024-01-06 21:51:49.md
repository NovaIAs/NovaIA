This code performs a variety of complex data analysis tasks using different machine learning algorithms. It generates a large dataset, fits a linear regression model to the data, evaluates the model's performance, performs principal component analysis (PCA) on the data, trains a support vector machine (SVM) classifier on the data, and creates and trains a neural network model on the data. The code also plots the data and the fitted plane, as well as the data in the principal component space.

Here is a detailed explanation of the code:

* The first few lines of the code import the necessary Julia packages.
* The `data` variable is generated by randomly sampling from a normal distribution to create a dataset of 10,000 points in 3 dimensions.
* The `model` variable is created to represent the linear regression model.
* The `fit!` function is used to fit the linear regression model to the data.
* The `figure()` function is used to create a new figure window.
* The `scatter()` function is used to plot the data points.
* The `plot!()` function is used to plot the fitted plane.
* The `xlabel()`, `ylabel()`, and `zlabel()` functions are used to label the axes of the plot.
* The `title()` function is used to set the title of the plot.
* The `r2score()` function is used to calculate the R-squared value, which is a measure of the goodness of fit of the model.
* The `println()` function is used to print the R-squared value to the console.
* The `pca` variable is created to represent the PCA model.
* The `fit!()` function is used to fit the PCA model to the data.
* The `transform()` function is used to project the data onto the first two principal components.
* The `figure()` function is used to create a new figure window.
* The `scatter()` function is used to plot the data points in the principal component space.
* The `xlabel()` and `ylabel()` functions are used to label the axes of the plot.
* The `title()` function is used to set the title of the plot.
* The `svm` variable is created to represent the SVM classifier.
* The `fit!()` function is used to fit the SVM classifier to the data.
* The `accuracy()` function is used to calculate the accuracy of the SVM classifier.
* The `println()` function is used to print the accuracy value to the console.
* The `nn` variable is created to represent the neural network model.
* The `train!()` function is used to train the neural network model on the data.
* The `loss()` function is used to calculate the loss of the neural network model.
* The `println()` function is used to print the loss value to the console.
