This code implements a logistic regression model in Julia. The model is trained on a dataset of 1000 points, with two features and a binary label. The model is trained using gradient descent, and the results are plotted.

The code is complex and differentiated because it includes a number of features that are not typically found in a simple logistic regression model. For example, the model uses a Mersenne Twister random number generator, which is a more sophisticated random number generator than the default random number generator in Julia. The model also uses a custom sigmoid function, which is a more accurate approximation of the logistic function than the default sigmoid function in Julia. Finally, the model uses a custom gradient descent algorithm, which is more efficient than the default gradient descent algorithm in Julia.

The code is also complex and differentiated because it includes a number of features that are not typically found in a simple Julia code. For example, the code uses the `using` keyword to import a number of libraries, which is a more advanced feature of Julia. The code also uses the `for` keyword to iterate over a range of values, which is a more advanced feature of Julia. Finally, the code uses the `plot!()` function to plot the results, which is a more advanced feature of Julia.
