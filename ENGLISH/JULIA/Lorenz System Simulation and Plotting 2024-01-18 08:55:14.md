This code simulates the Lorenz system, a chaotic system of three ordinary differential equations. The system is defined by the following equations:

```
dx/dt = σ * (y - x)
dy/dt = ρ * x - y - x * z
dz/dt = x * y - β * z
```

where σ, ρ, and β are parameters. The code uses the `DifferentialEquations.jl` package to solve the system numerically. The `sol` object contains the solution to the system, which is a vector of time points and the corresponding values of x, y, and z. The code then plots the solution using the `Plots.jl` package.

The Lorenz system is a chaotic system, meaning that it is very sensitive to initial conditions. This means that even a small change in the initial conditions can lead to a large change in the solution. This makes the Lorenz system a good model for studying chaotic behavior.
