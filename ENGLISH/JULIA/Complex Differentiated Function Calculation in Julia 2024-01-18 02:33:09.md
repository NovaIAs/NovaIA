# This Julia code defines a complex and differentiated function that involves various mathematical operations and conditional statements.

Explanation of the Code:

1. **Function Definition**: We define a function named `f` that takes three arguments `x`, `y`, and `z`, all of which are real numbers (indicated by `::Real`).

2. **Calculating Sine of `x`**: Inside the function, we calculate the sine of `x` using the `sin` function and store the result in the variable `s`.

3. **Conditional Statement for `y`**: We use an `if` statement to check if `y` is greater than 0. If it is, we calculate the square root of `y` using the `sqrt` function and store it in the variable `r`. If `y` is not greater than 0, we set `r` to 0.

4. **Calculating Exponential of `z`**: We calculate the exponential of `z` using the `exp` function and store the result in the variable `e`.

5. **Calculating the Function Value `f`**: We calculate the value of the function `f` using the formula:
   `f(x, y, z) = (sin(x) + sqrt(y) + exp(z)) / (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)`.
   We use the previously calculated values of `s`, `r`, and `e` in this formula.

6. **Return Value**: The function `f` returns the calculated value of `f(x, y, z)` as its result.

7. **Input Values and Function Call**: We define input values for `x`, `y`, and `z`. Then, we call the function `f` with these input values and store the result in the variable `result`.

8. **Displaying the Result**: Finally, we use the `println` function to display the result of `f(x, y, z)`.

This code demonstrates a complex and differentiated function that involves a combination of mathematical operations, conditional statements, and function definitions. The code is written in a structured and readable manner, with clear variable names and comments to explain the purpose of each section.
