This code solves a nonlinear differential equation using the `DifferentialEquations.jl` package. The specific equation being solved is the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model, which describes the population dynamics of two species, a predator and a prey.

The code begins by defining the differential equation model in the `diff_eq` function. This function takes as input the current state of the system, the parameters of the model, and the time, and returns the rate of change of the system state.

Next, the code generates some data by simulating the differential equation model with known parameters and adding some noise. The data is then plotted.

The objective function is then defined, which takes as input the parameters of the model, the data, and the time, and returns the mean squared error between the model solution and the data.

The optimization problem is then defined, which minimizes the objective function with respect to the parameters of the model. The optimization problem is solved using the `OptimToolbox.jl` package.

Finally, the estimated parameters are extracted from the optimization result and used to solve the differential equation model again. The estimated solution is then plotted along with the true solution and the noisy data.

The code prints the true and estimated parameters, which shows that the estimated parameters are close to the true parameters, indicating that the optimization procedure was successful in finding a good fit to the data.
