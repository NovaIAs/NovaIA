This is a code that solves a system of differential equations known as the Lotka-Volterra equations. These equations describe the population dynamics of two species, a prey and a predator, that interact through predation.

The code starts by defining the differential equation system, which is a set of two equations that describe the rate of change of the prey and predator populations over time. The equations are given in terms of the following parameters:

* α: the prey growth rate
* β: the predation rate
* γ: the predator death rate
* δ: the conversion efficiency of prey to predator biomass

The code then sets the initial conditions for the system, which are the initial populations of the prey and predator. It also sets the values of the parameters.

Next, the code solves the differential equation system using the DifferentialEquations.jl package. The solution is stored in the variable `sol`.

Finally, the code plots the solution using the Plots.jl package. The plot shows the populations of the prey and predator over time.

The interactive plot at the end of the code allows you to zoom and pan the plot, as well as save it in a variety of formats.
