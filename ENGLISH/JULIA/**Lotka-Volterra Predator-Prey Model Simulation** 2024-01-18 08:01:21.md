This code simulates the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model, which describes the population dynamics of two species that interact through predation. The model consists of two differential equations that describe the rate of change of the population sizes of the predator and prey species.

```julia
# Import necessary libraries
import DifferentialEquations, Plots

# Define a system of differential equations
f(u, v) = [
    u * (1 - u - v),  # Equation for the rate of change of the prey population
    v * (1 - v - u)   # Equation for the rate of change of the predator population
]

# Generate initial conditions
tspan = 0:0.01:100
u0 = 0.5  # Initial prey population size
v0 = 0.5  # Initial predator population size

# Solve the system of differential equations
sol = solve(f, [u0, v0], tspan; reltol=1e-3, abstol=1e-6)

# Extract the solution
u = sol[:, 1]  # Extract the prey population solution
v = sol[:, 2]  # Extract the predator population solution

# Plot the solution
plot(tspan, u, label="Prey Population")
plot!(tspan, v, label="Predator Population")

# Add legend and title

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
    * `DifferentialEquations`: Used for solving the system of differential equations.
    * `Plots`: Used for plotting the solution.

2. Define the system of differential equations:
    * The `f` function defines the system of differential equations. It takes two variables, `u` and `v`, representing the population sizes of the prey and predator species, respectively. The equations describe the rate of change of these populations over time.

3. Generate initial conditions:
    * `tspan` is a vector of time values over which the differential equations will be solved.
    * `u0` and `v0` specify the initial population sizes of the prey and predator species.

4. Solve the system of differential equations:
    * `solve` function is used to solve the system of differential equations. It takes the `f` function, the initial conditions `[u0, v0]`, and the time span `tspan`. The `reltol` and `abstol` parameters specify the relative and absolute tolerances for the solution.

5. Extract the solution:
    * `u` and `v` are vectors containing the solutions for the prey and predator populations over time.

6. Plot the solution:
    * The solution is plotted using the `plot` and `plot!` functions. The `label` argument is used to label the lines in the plot.

7. Add legend and title:
    * `xlabel!`, `ylabel!`, and `title!` functions are used to add labels and a title to the plot.

8. Show the plot:
    * `show()` function is used to display the plot.
