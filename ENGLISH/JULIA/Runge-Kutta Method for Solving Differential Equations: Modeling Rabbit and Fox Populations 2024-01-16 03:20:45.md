This code solves a system of differential equations using the Runge-Kutta method. The differential equation system models the population dynamics of rabbits and foxes. The code first defines the differential equation system, then solves it using the Runge-Kutta method, and finally plots the solution.

The differential equation system is defined by the function `f`. The function takes two arguments: the time `t` and the state `y`. The state `y` is a vector of two elements, where `y[1]` is the population of rabbits and `y[2]` is the population of foxes. The function `f` returns a vector of two elements, where `f[1]` is the rate of change of the rabbit population and `f[2]` is the rate of change of the fox population.

The Runge-Kutta method is a numerical method for solving differential equations. The method approximates the solution of the differential equation system by taking a series of steps. At each step, the method uses the current state of the system to calculate the next state.

The code solves the differential equation system using the `solve_rk4` function. The function takes three arguments: the differential equation system `f`, the time span `tspan`, and the initial condition `y0`. The time span `tspan` is a tuple of the start and end times of the simulation. The initial condition `y0` is the state of the system at the start of the simulation. The function returns a matrix `y` of the solution of the differential equation system.

The code plots the solution of the differential equation system using the `plot_solution` function. The function takes one argument: the solution `y`. The function plots the population of rabbits and foxes over time.

The code first defines the initial condition `y0` of the system. The initial condition is a vector of two elements, where `y0[1]` is the population of rabbits and `y0[2]` is the population of foxes.

The code then calls the `solve_rk4` function to solve the differential equation system. The function takes three arguments: the differential equation system `f`, the time span `tspan`, and the initial condition `y0`. The function returns a matrix `y` of the solution of the differential equation system.

The code then calls the `plot_solution` function to plot the solution of the differential equation system. The function takes one argument: the solution `y`. The function plots the population of rabbits and foxes over time.
