This code simulates the Lorenz attractor, a chaotic dynamical system that is widely used as a benchmark for testing numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The code uses the `DifferentialEquations.jl` package to solve the Lorenz system of equations.

The Lorenz system is defined by the following three equations:

```
dx/dt = σ(y - x)
dy/dt = ρx - y - xz
dz/dt = xy - βz
```

where `σ`, `ρ`, and `β` are parameters. The default values of these parameters are `σ = 10`, `ρ = 28`, and `β = 8/3`.

The code begins by defining the `lorenz_system` function, which takes as input a state vector `u`, a parameter vector `p`, and a time `t`. The function returns the derivatives of the state vector with respect to time.

The next step is to define the initial conditions for the simulation. In this case, the initial state is `u0 = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]`.

The parameters for the simulation are then defined. The default values of `σ`, `ρ`, and `β` are used.

The time interval for the simulation is specified next. The default interval is `tspan = (0.0, 100.0)`.

The `solve` function is then used to solve the Lorenz system of equations. The function takes as input the `lorenz_system` function, the initial conditions `u0`, the time interval `tspan`, and the parameter vector `p`. The function returns a solution object, which contains the solution to the ODE system.

The solution object is then used to extract the solution components `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Finally, the `plot` function is used to plot the solution. The function takes as input the `x`, `y`, and `z` vectors and plots them in a 3D plot. The title of the plot is "Lorenz Attractor" and the legend is turned off.

The resulting plot shows the Lorenz attractor, which is a chaotic attractor that is characterized by its butterfly-shaped structure.
