This code solves the Lorenz system of differential equations, which is a chaotic system that exhibits strange attractors. The code uses the DifferentialEquations.jl package to solve the differential equations and the Plots.jl package to plot the results.

The Lorenz system is defined by the following three differential equations:

```
dx/dt = σ * (y - x)
dy/dt = ρ * x - y - x * z
dz/dt = -β * z + x * y
```

where σ, ρ, and β are parameters. The initial conditions are given by the vector u0.

The code first defines the differential equation system using the function `lorenz`. This function takes four arguments: `du`, `u`, `p`, and `t`. The `du` argument is a vector of derivatives, the `u` argument is a vector of state variables, the `p` argument is a vector of parameters, and the `t` argument is the time.

The code then sets the parameters, initial conditions, and time span.

The code then uses the `solve` function to solve the differential equation system. The `solve` function takes three arguments: the differential equation system, the initial conditions, and the time span. The `solve` function returns a `Solution` object, which contains the solution to the differential equation system.

The code then uses the `plot` function to plot the solution. The `plot` function takes two arguments: the `Solution` object and the variables to plot. The `plot` function plots the solution for the specified variables.

The code then calculates the Lyapunov exponents for the Lorenz system. The Lyapunov exponents are a measure of the stability of the system. The code uses the `lyapunov_spectrum` function to calculate the Lyapunov exponents. The `lyapunov_spectrum` function takes three arguments: the differential equation system, the initial conditions, and the time span. The `lyapunov_spectrum` function returns a vector of Lyapunov exponents.

The code then uses the `plot` function to plot the Lyapunov exponents. The `plot` function takes two arguments: the vector of Lyapunov exponents and the labels for the plot. The `plot` function plots the Lyapunov exponents with the specified labels.
