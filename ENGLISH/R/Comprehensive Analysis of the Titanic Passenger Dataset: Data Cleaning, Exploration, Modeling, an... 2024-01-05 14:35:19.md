This code performs a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic passenger dataset, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and visualization.

The data is first cleaned by removing missing values and imputing missing values for the Age, Cabin, and Embarked variables.

The data is then explored using summary statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution of passengers and survival rates across different variables.

Dummy variables are created for categorical variables to prepare the data for modeling.

The data is split into training and testing sets, and two models are trained: a random forest model and a decision tree model.

The models are evaluated on the test set to assess their accuracy.

Finally, the decision tree model is visualized to understand the decision-making process of the model.

This code is complex and differentiated because it covers a wide range of data analysis tasks, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and visualization.

The code also uses a variety of R packages, such as tidyverse, ggplot2, caret, randomForest, and rpart, to perform these tasks.

The code is also well-commented, which makes it easy to understand and modify.
