This code is a complex and differentiated R code that performs the following tasks:

1. Loads the necessary libraries.
2. Loads the data from a CSV file.
3. Cleans and prepares the data by removing duplicate rows, converting the date column to date format, and creating new columns for the year, month, and day of the date.
4. Creates a linear regression model using the tidymodels package.
5. Trains the model on the data.
6. Evaluates the model's performance using various metrics.
7. Creates a plot of the model's predictions.
8. Saves the trained model to a file.
9. Loads the saved model from the file.
10. Makes predictions using the saved model on new data.

This code is complex and differentiated because it covers a wide range of data science tasks, including data cleaning, data preparation, model training, model evaluation, model prediction, and model saving and loading. It also uses a variety of R packages, including tidyverse, ggplot2, lubridate, and tidymodels, to perform these tasks.
