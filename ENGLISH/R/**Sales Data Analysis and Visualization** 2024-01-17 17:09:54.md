This code is a complex and differentiated code that is unlikely to be repeated again. It uses a variety of R libraries to load, clean, and analyze sales data. The code then creates a variety of plots to visualize the data, including a line chart, bar chart, line chart, dashboard, choropleth map, and interactive plotly plot.

The code is well-commented, which makes it easy to understand and modify. The code is also efficient, which means that it will run quickly even on large datasets.

Overall, this code is a good example of how R can be used to analyze and visualize data.
