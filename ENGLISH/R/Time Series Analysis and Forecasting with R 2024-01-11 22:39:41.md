This code is a complex and differentiated R code that performs a variety of tasks, including data cleaning, time series analysis, forecasting, and machine learning.

The code begins by loading the necessary libraries, including the tidyverse, lubridate, ggplot2, forecast, and xgboost libraries.

Next, the code loads the data from a CSV file and cleans it by removing any missing values and converting the date column to a Date object.

A time series object is then created from the data, and a seasonal ARIMA model is fitted to the time series. The fitted model is then plotted.

The code then forecasts the time series for the next 12 months and plots the forecast. The accuracy of the forecast is then evaluated and printed.

Finally, the code creates a xgboost model, trains the model, and evaluates the model. The evaluation metric is then printed.

This code is complex and differentiated because it performs a variety of tasks, including data cleaning, time series analysis, forecasting, and machine learning. The code also uses a variety of libraries, including the tidyverse, lubridate, ggplot2, forecast, and xgboost libraries.
