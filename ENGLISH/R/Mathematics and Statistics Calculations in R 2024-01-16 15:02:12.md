Explanation:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence:**
   - The `fibonacci` function calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.
   - It initializes the first two terms and then iterates to calculate subsequent terms as the sum of the previous two.

2. **Factorial:**
   - The `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a given number.
   - It initializes the factorial to 1 and then iterates to multiply the factorial by each number from 1 to the given number.

3. **Mean:**
   - The `mean` function calculates the mean (average) of a given vector of numbers.
   - It calculates the sum of all the numbers in the vector and divides it by the number of elements.

4. **Median:**
   - The `median` function calculates the median of a given vector of numbers.
   - It sorts the vector, finds the middle index, and returns the middle value if the vector length is odd or the average of the two middle values if the vector length is even.

5. **Standard Deviation:**
   - The `sd` function calculates the standard deviation of a given vector of numbers.
   - It calculates the mean, variance, and finally the standard deviation as the square root of the variance.

6. **Linear Regression:**
   - The `linear_regression` function performs linear regression on a given dataset.
   - It calculates the slope and intercept of the regression line using the ordinary least squares method.

This code demonstrates various mathematical and statistical calculations in R, including the Fibonacci sequence, factorial, mean, median, standard deviation, and linear regression. It provides a comprehensive example of complex R code that can be used for data analysis and modeling.
