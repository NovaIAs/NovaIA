This code is a complex and differentiated example of a data analysis script in R. It reads data from a CSV file, preprocesses it, and then calculates the daily, monthly, hourly, minute, and second average values for each year. Finally, it plots the results of these calculations.

The code is well-commented and easy to understand, even for beginners. It uses a variety of R functions and techniques, including:

* The `tidyverse` package: The tidyverse is a collection of R packages that provides a consistent and user-friendly interface for data manipulation and analysis.
* The `lubridate` package: The lubridate package provides a set of functions for working with dates and times in R.
* The `ggplot2` package: The ggplot2 package is a powerful graphics package for creating visualizations in R.

This code is a good example of how R can be used to perform complex data analysis tasks. It can be used as a starting point for your own data analysis projects.
