Certainly! Here's a complex and unique R code that performs sentiment analysis on a large dataset of tweets:

```R
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(syuzhet)

# Read the dataset of tweets
tweets <- read_csv("tweets.csv")

# Perform data preprocessing
tweets_cleaned <- tweets %>%
  mutate(text_cleaned = tolower(text)) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text_cleaned) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)

# Calculate sentiment scores for each tweet
sentiment_scores <- get_sentiment(tweets_cleaned$word)

# Add sentiment scores to the original dataset
tweets_with_scores <- cbind(tweets_cleaned, sentiment_scores)

# Calculate overall sentiment scores for each tweet
aggregate_sentiment <- tweets_with_scores %>%
  group_by(tweet_id) %>%
  summarise(sentiment_score = sum(sentiment))

# Classify each tweet as positive, negative or neutral based on sentiment scores
tweets_with_sentiment <- aggregate_sentiment %>%
  mutate(sentiment_class = case_when(
    sentiment_score > 0 ~ "Positive",
    sentiment_score < 0 ~ "Negative",
    TRUE ~ "Neutral"
  ))

# Visualize the distribution of sentiment classes
ggplot(tweets_with_sentiment, aes(x = sentiment_class)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Sentiment Class", y = "Count", title = "Distribution of Sentiment Classes")

# Export the results to a CSV file
write_csv(tweets_with_sentiment, "sentiment_analysis_results.csv")
```

Explanation:
1. The code starts by loading the required libraries, including `tidyverse`, `tidytext`, and `syuzhet`.
2. It reads the dataset of tweets from a CSV file and stores it in the variable `tweets`.
3. Data preprocessing steps are performed, including converting the tweet text to lowercase, tokenizing the words, and removing stop words.
4. Sentiment scores for each word in the cleaned tweets are calculated using the `get_sentiment` function from the `syuzhet` library.
5. The sentiment scores are added to the original dataset of tweets.
6. Overall sentiment scores are aggregated for each tweet using the `summarise` function.
7. Each tweet is classified as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment scores using the `case_when` function.
8. The distribution of sentiment classes is visualized using a bar plot.
9. The results, including the sentiment class and sentiment score for each tweet, are exported to a CSV file named "sentiment_analysis_results.csv".

This code performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets, allowing you to understand the overall sentiment expressed in the tweets and classify them into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
