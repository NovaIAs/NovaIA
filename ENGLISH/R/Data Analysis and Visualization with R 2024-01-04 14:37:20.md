```r
# Create a vector of numbers from 1 to 100

# Create a data frame with three columns: "number", "square", and "cube"
data <- data.frame(
  number = numbers,

# Print the data frame
print(data)

# Add a line of best fit to the scatterplot
abline(lm(square ~ number, data = data), col = "red")

# Create a histogram of the data in the "cube" column

# Create a bar chart of the data in the "number" column

# Create a pie chart of the data in the "number" column

This code is a complex and differentiated R code that performs a variety of statistical analyses on a data frame of numbers. The code includes the following steps:

1. Create a vector of numbers from 1 to 100.
2. Create a data frame with three columns: "number", "square", and "cube".
3. Print the data frame.
4. Create a scatterplot of the data, with "number" on the x-axis and "square" on the y-axis.
5. Add a line of best fit to the scatterplot.
6. Create a histogram of the data in the "cube" column.
7. Create a bar chart of the data in the "number" column.
8. Create a pie chart of the data in the "number" column.
9. Create a boxplot of the data in the "square" column.
10. Create a normal probability plot of the data in the "cube" column.
11. Create a correlation matrix of the data.
12. Perform a principal component analysis on the data.
13. Print the results of the principal component analysis.
14. Create a biplot of the principal component analysis results.
15. Create a dendrogram of the data.
16. Create a heatmap of the data.

This code is a powerful tool for exploring and analyzing data. It can be used to identify patterns and relationships in the data, and to make predictions about future outcomes.
