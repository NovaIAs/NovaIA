Explanation:

_User Interface_:
- The ui is the user interface of the shiny app. It defines the layout and components of the app.
 
- The shiny app has a title panel, a sidebar layout, and a main panel.

- The sidebar layout contains a date range input component, which allows the user to select a date range.

- The main panel contains a plotOutput component, which will display the plot.

_Server Function_:
- The server function defines the behavior of the shiny app. It receives input from the user interface and generates output.

- The renderPlot function is used to generate the plot. It uses the ggplot2 library to create a line plot of the COVID-19 cases over time.

- The plot is filtered to only show the data within the selected date range.

- The plot is then rendered and displayed in the main panel of the app.

This code creates a shiny app that allows the user to visualize the daily COVID-19 cases in the United States over a selected date range. The app uses the `shiny`, `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, and `ggplot2` libraries. The code is complex and differentiated because it combines multiple libraries and functions to create an interactive data visualization app.
