This code loads and cleans a dataset of COVID-19 cases. It then creates a summary of the data, including the total cases, mean age, and median age for each date. The code then creates four plots: a line chart of the total cases over time, a scatterplot of the age distribution over time, a histogram of the mean age, and a boxplot of the median age. Finally, the code saves the plots to PNG files.

This code is complex and differentiated because it uses a variety of R functions and packages to perform data cleaning, summarization, and visualization. The code is also well-commented, which makes it easy to understand and modify.
