This code performs the following steps:

1. Imports the necessary libraries.
2. Loads the data from a CSV file.
3. Preprocesses the data by converting the date and time columns to the appropriate formats and creating a `datetime` column.
4. Creates a recipe for the data using the `recipe` package, which includes steps for converting the `datetime` column to individual year, month, day, hour, minute, and second columns and dummy coding all nominal variables.
5. Splits the data into training and test sets using the `initial_split()` function from the `rsample` package.
6. Creates a random forest model using the `rand_forest()` function from the `tidymodels` package.
7. Trains the model using the training data.
8. Evaluates the model using the test data and calculates the accuracy.
9. Prints the results.
10. Plots the results using the `ggplot()` function from the `ggplot2` package.
