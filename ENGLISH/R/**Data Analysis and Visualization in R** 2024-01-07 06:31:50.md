This code is a complex and differentiated R code that performs a variety of data analysis tasks on a data frame. The code includes:

* Loading the tidyverse package, which is a collection of packages for data science in R.
* Creating a data frame with a variety of data types, including numeric, character, and logical data.
* Printing the data frame.
* Creating a bar chart of the age distribution.
* Creating a pie chart of the gender distribution.
* Creating a scatterplot of the relationship between age and balance.
* Creating a table of the summary statistics for each variable.
* Creating a linear regression model to predict balance from age.
* Printing the summary of the model.
* Creating a residual plot for the model.
* Creating a QQ plot for the model.
* Creating a function to calculate the mean of a vector.
* Applying the mean function to the balance column of the data frame.
* Printing the data frame.

This code is complex and differentiated because it performs a variety of data analysis tasks on a data frame. The code also includes a variety of data types, including numeric, character, and logical data. The code is also well-commented, making it easy to understand and follow.
