This code performs the following tasks:

1. Loads the necessary R libraries.
2. Loads the data from a CSV file.
3. Cleans and prepares the data by removing missing values and selecting only the date and value columns.
4. Calculates the moving average of the value column using a 7-day window.
5. Plots the original data and the moving average usingggplot2.
6. Creates a Shiny app that allows the user to interactively change the window size of the moving average and see the updated plot.

This code is complex because it combines multiple R libraries, data wrangling techniques, and data visualization techniques to create a Shiny app that allows the user to explore the time series data in an interactive way.
