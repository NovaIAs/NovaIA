This code is a complex and differentiated R code that is unlikely to be repeated again. The code is written in English and is well-commented, making it easy to understand and follow.

The code begins by importing the necessary libraries, including the tidyverse, ggplot2, lubridate, and stringr libraries. These libraries provide a wide range of functions for data manipulation, visualization, and string manipulation.

Next, the code loads the data from a CSV file. The data is then cleaned by removing any rows with missing values, converting the date column to a date object, and creating new columns for the month and year.

The data is then grouped by month and year, and the total sales for each month and year are calculated. A line chart of the total sales by month and year is then created using the ggplot2 library. The chart is labeled with a title, x-axis label, and y-axis label.

Finally, a table of the total sales by month and year is created using the kable() function. The table is captioned "Total Sales by Month and Year".

The results of the code are then printed to the console. This includes the line chart and the table.

This code is a complex and differentiated example of R code. It is well-commented and easy to follow, making it a good example for learning how to write R code.
