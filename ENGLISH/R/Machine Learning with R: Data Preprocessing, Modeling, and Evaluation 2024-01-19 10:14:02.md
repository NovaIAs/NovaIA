This code is a complex and differentiated code in the R language. It is unlikely to be repeated again. The code is written in English and is easy to understand.

The code first loads the necessary libraries. Then, it imports the data from a CSV file. The data is then preprocessed, and a training and testing set is created. A recipe for the data is then created, and a workflow for the data is created. The model is then trained, and the results are evaluated. A plot of the results is then created, and the model is saved.

This code is a good example of how to use the tidyverse and lubridate libraries to work with data in R. It is also a good example of how to use the tidymodels library to create and train models in R.
