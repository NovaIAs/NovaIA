Here is a complex and differentiated R code that is unlikely to be repeated:

```r
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(patchwork)

# Simulate a large dataset
set.seed(123)
df <- data.frame(
  id = sample(1:10000, 10000, replace = TRUE),
  date = seq(as.Date("2020-01-01"), as.Date("2020-12-31"), by = "day"),
  value = rnorm(10000 * 365, mean = 0, sd = 1)
)

# Reshape the data for time series analysis
df_long <- df %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = value, names_to = "variable", values_to = "measurement")

# Create a time series plot
ggplot(df_long, aes(x = date, y = measurement, color = variable)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~id) +
  labs(title = "Time Series Plot of Simulated Data",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Measurement",
       color = "Variable")

# Calculate daily and monthly moving averages
df_long <- df_long %>%
  group_by(id, variable) %>%
  mutate(
    daily_mean = rollmean(measurement, k = 7),
    monthly_mean = rollmean(measurement, k = 30, align = "right")
  )

# Create a plot comparing the original data with the moving averages
ggplot(df_long, aes(x = date, y = measurement, color = variable)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_line(aes(y = daily_mean), linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_line(aes(y = monthly_mean), linetype = "dotted") +
  facet_wrap(~id) +
  labs(title = "Comparison of Original Data with Moving Averages",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Measurement",
       color = "Variable")

# Perform seasonal decomposition of the time series
df_long <- df_long %>%
  group_by(id, variable) %>%
  decompose(type = "seasonal")

# Create a plot showing the seasonal components
ggplot(df_long, aes(x = date, y = seasonal, color = variable)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~id) +
  labs(title = "Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Seasonal Component",
       color = "Variable")

# Fit a linear regression model to the data
df_long <- df_long %>%
  group_by(id, variable) %>%
  lm(measurement ~ date)

# Create a plot showing the regression line
ggplot(df_long, aes(x = date, y = measurement, color = variable)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~id) +
  labs(title = "Linear Regression of Time Series",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Measurement",
       color = "Variable")

# Print the regression results
print(df_long %>%
  group_by(id, variable) %>%
  summarize(coef = coef(lm)[2]))

# Create a heatmap of the regression coefficients
ggplot(df_long %>%
  group_by(id, variable) %>%
  summarize(coef = coef(lm)[2]),
  aes(x = variable, y = id, fill = coef)) +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(title = "Heatmap of Regression Coefficients",
       x = "Variable",
       y = "ID",
       fill = "Coefficient")
```

This code is complex and differentiated because it:

* Utilizes multiple R libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.
* Simulates a large dataset with a time series structure.
* Reshapes the data into a format suitable for time series analysis.
* Creates various plots to visualize the time series data, including a line chart, a comparison of original data with moving averages, a seasonal decomposition plot, and a regression line.
* Fits a linear regression model to the data and prints the regression results.
* Creates a heatmap of the regression coefficients to visualize the relationship between different variables and the regression coefficients.

This code is unlikely to be repeated again because it is highly specific to the simulated dataset and the analysis tasks at hand. However, it demonstrates the power and versatility of the R programming language for complex data analysis and visualization.
