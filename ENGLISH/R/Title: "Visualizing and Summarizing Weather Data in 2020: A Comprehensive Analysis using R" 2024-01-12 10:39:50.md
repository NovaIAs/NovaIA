Explanation:

* The code begins by loading the required libraries.
* The data is then defined using the `data.frame()` function.
* The date column is converted to a POSIXct object using the `as.POSIXct()` function.
* Three plots are created using the `ggplot()` function:
    * A time series plot of the temperature and precipitation data.
    * A histogram of the precipitation data.
    * A scatter plot of the temperature and precipitation data.
* The three plots are combined into a single plot using the `plot_grid()` function.
* The plot is saved as a PDF file using the `ggsave()` function.
* A summary table of the temperature and precipitation data is generated using the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions.
* The summary table is printed using the `print()` function.
