Certainly! Here's a complex and unique R code that performs a sentiment analysis on a large dataset of social media posts. It utilizes various data manipulation techniques and natural language processing libraries. Let's break it down step by step:

```R
# Load required libraries
library(tm)
library(SnowballC)
library(topicmodels)
library(dplyr)

# Read the dataset
data <- read.csv("social_media_data.csv")

# Preprocess the text data
corpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(data$text))
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, content_transformer(tolower))
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, removePunctuation)
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, removeNumbers)
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, removeWords, stopwords("english"))
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, stripWhitespace)
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, stemDocument)

# Create a document-term matrix
dtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(corpus)

# Perform sentiment analysis using LDA topic modeling
lda_model <- LDA(dtm, k = 5, control = list(seed = 1234))
topics <- tidy(lda_model, matrix = "beta")

# Assign sentiment labels to each topic
sentiment <- c("positive", "negative", "neutral", "positive", "negative")
topics <- mutate(topics, sentiment = sentiment)

# Calculate the sentiment score for each social media post
sentiment_scores <- topics %>%
  select(-sentiment) %>%
  rowSums()

# Categorize sentiment scores
sentiment_labels <- cut(sentiment_scores, breaks = c(-Inf, -2, 2, Inf),
                        labels = c("negative", "neutral", "positive"))

# Add sentiment labels to the original dataset
data <- cbind(data, sentiment = sentiment_labels)

# Output the results
write.csv(data, "sentiment_analysis_results.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

Explanation:

1. Load the required libraries: The code starts by loading the necessary libraries for text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and data manipulation.

2. Read the dataset: The code reads the social media data from a CSV file called "social_media_data.csv".

3. Preprocess the text data: The code preprocesses the text data by converting it to lowercase, removing punctuation, numbers, stop words, and whitespaces, and stemming the words.

4. Create a document-term matrix: The code creates a document-term matrix, which represents the frequency of words in the corpus.

5. Perform sentiment analysis using LDA topic modeling: The code applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling on the document-term matrix to identify different topics in the social media posts.

6. Assign sentiment labels to each topic: The code assigns sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral) to each identified topic.

7. Calculate the sentiment score for each social media post: The code calculates the sentiment score for each social media post by summing the topic probabilities for each post.

8. Categorize sentiment scores: The code categorizes the sentiment scores into three categories: negative, neutral, and positive.

9. Add sentiment labels to the original dataset: The code adds the sentiment labels to the original dataset.

10. Output the results: The code saves the results, including the original social media posts and their corresponding sentiment labels, to a CSV file called "sentiment_analysis_results.csv".

Please note that this code assumes you have a CSV file named "social_media_data.csv" with a column named "text" containing the social media posts. Adjust the code accordingly based on your dataset structure.
