Sure, here is a complex and differentiated code in R:

```r
# Create a dataframe with multiple columns and rows
df <- data.frame(
  id = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  name = c("John", "Mary", "Bob", "Alice", "Tom"),
  age = c(25, 30, 35, 40, 45),
  city = c("New York", "Los Angeles", "Chicago", "Houston", "Phoenix"),
  salary = c(10000, 20000, 30000, 40000, 50000)
)

# Print the dataframe
print(df)

# Use the dplyr package for data manipulation
library(dplyr)

# Filter the dataframe to include only rows where age is greater than 30
df_filtered <- df %>%
  filter(age > 30)

# Print the filtered dataframe
print(df_filtered)

# Use the ggplot2 package for data visualization
library(ggplot2)

# Create a bar chart showing the distribution of salary by city
ggplot(df, aes(x = city, y = salary)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  labs(title = "Salary Distribution by City",
       x = "City",
       y = "Salary")

# Print the bar chart
print(ggplot)

# Use the tidymodels package for machine learning
library(tidymodels)

# Split the dataframe into training and test sets
df_train <- df %>%
  initial_split(prop = 0.75)

df_test <- df %>%
  final_split(prop = 0.25)

# Create a linear regression model
model <- linear_reg() %>%
  fit(salary ~ age + city, data = df_train)

# Evaluate the model on the test set
model %>%
  predict(df_test) %>%
  rmse(df_test$salary)
```

This code is complex because it uses multiple R packages and performs a variety of data operations, including data manipulation, data visualization, and machine learning. It is also differentiated because it uses a variety of R functions, including the `data.frame()` function, the ` %>% ` pipe operator, the `filter()` function, the `ggplot()` function, the `geom_bar()` function, the `labs()` function, the `initial_split()` function, the `final_split()` function, the `linear_reg()` function, the `fit()` function, the `predict()` function, and the `rmse()` function.

Here is a brief explanation of the code:

* The first few lines of the code create a dataframe called `df` with multiple columns and rows.
* The next few lines of the code use the `dplyr` package to filter the dataframe to include only rows where age is greater than 30.
* The next few lines of the code use the `ggplot2` package to create a bar chart showing the distribution of salary by city.
* The next few lines of the code use the `tidymodels` package to split the dataframe into training and test sets, create a linear regression model, and evaluate the model on the test set.
