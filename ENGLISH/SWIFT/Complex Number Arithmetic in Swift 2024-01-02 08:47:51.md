Sure! Here's a complex and unique Swift code that combines various programming concepts:

```swift
import Foundation

// Define a custom data structure called ComplexNumber
struct ComplexNumber {
    var real: Double
    var imaginary: Double
    
    init(real: Double, imaginary: Double) {
        self.real = real
        self.imaginary = imaginary
    }
    
    // Define a computed property to calculate the modulus of the complex number
    var modulus: Double {
        return sqrt(real * real + imaginary * imaginary)
    }
    
    // Define a method to add two complex numbers
    func add(_ other: ComplexNumber) -> ComplexNumber {
        return ComplexNumber(real: real + other.real, imaginary: imaginary + other.imaginary)
    }
    
    // Define a method to multiply two complex numbers
    func multiply(_ other: ComplexNumber) -> ComplexNumber {
        let realResult = real * other.real - imaginary * other.imaginary
        let imaginaryResult = real * other.imaginary + imaginary * other.real
        return ComplexNumber(real: realResult, imaginary: imaginaryResult)
    }
}

// Create two complex numbers
let complex1 = ComplexNumber(real: 3, imaginary: 4)
let complex2 = ComplexNumber(real: -2, imaginary: 1)

// Calculate the modulus of complex1
let modulus = complex1.modulus
print("Modulus of complex1: \(modulus)")

// Add complex1 and complex2
let sum = complex1.add(complex2)
print("Sum of complex1 and complex2: \(sum.real) + \(sum.imaginary)i")

// Multiply complex1 and complex2
let product = complex1.multiply(complex2)
print("Product of complex1 and complex2: \(product.real) + \(product.imaginary)i")
```

In this code, we define a custom data structure called `ComplexNumber` to represent complex numbers. It has properties for the real and imaginary parts and methods for basic arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication.

The `modulus` property calculates the modulus of a complex number using the formula `sqrt(real * real + imaginary * imaginary)`. This property is a computed property, meaning it's calculated on the fly whenever it's accessed.

The `add` method takes another complex number as a parameter and returns a new complex number that represents the sum of the two.

The `multiply` method takes another complex number as a parameter and returns a new complex number that represents the product of the two, using the formula `(a + bi) * (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i`.

Lastly, we create two instances of `ComplexNumber`, perform some operations on them, and print the results.
