**Explanation:**

This code is made in swift and it includes a very elaborated code of a video player , with a lot of different functions that make the user interaction more dynamic and easy to use. 

The code contains functions to play, pause, stop, and seek to a specific time in a video. It also provides information about the current state of the video player and its progress. The code uses AVFoundation framework to handle video playback and provides a custom video player view that can be added to any view controller. 

The code is divided into multiple classes and protocols:

- `VideoPlayerDelegate`: This protocol defines the methods that will be called by the video player to notify its delegate about changes in the player's state or progress.

- `VideoPlayerState`: This enum represents the different states that the video player can be in, such as playing, paused, stopped, or buffering.

- `VideoPlayer`: This class is the main implementation of the video player. It handles video playback, state changes, progress updates, and seeking.

The `VideoPlayer` class has several private properties and methods, as well as public methods for controlling the video player. The public methods include `loadVideo()`, `play()`, `pause()`, `stop()`, `seek(to:)`, and `updateProgress()`.

The `loadVideo()` method loads a video from a URL into the video player. The `play()` method starts playing the video, the `pause()` method pauses the video, the `stop()` method stops the video and resets the current time to the beginning, and the `seek(to:)` method seeks to a specific time in the video. The `updateProgress()` method updates the progress of the video player based on the current time and duration of the video.

The `VideoPlayer` class also uses `AVPlayer` and `AVPlayerLayer` to handle video playback and display. It adds observers to the `AVPlayer` to monitor changes in the player's state and progress, and it uses a timer to periodically update the progress of the video player.

Overall, this code provides a comprehensive and customizable video player that can be used in various applications.
