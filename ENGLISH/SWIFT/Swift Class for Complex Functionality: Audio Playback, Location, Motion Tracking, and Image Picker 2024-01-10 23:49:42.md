Explanation:

1. Import necessary modules: This line imports several modules that are required for the functionality of the class.

2. Define a custom error type: This line defines a custom error type called `CustomError` which can be used to handle potential errors in the class methods.

3. Create a class to encapsulate the functionality: This line creates a class called `ComplexFunctionality` which will encapsulate all the complex functionality.

4. Initialize properties: This line initializes properties for the class, including an audio player, a location manager, a motion manager, and an image picker controller.

5. Define a method to play an audio file: This method takes an audio URL as an argument and tries to load and play the audio file using the audio player. If any error occurs during this process, it throws a `CustomError` of type `.operationFailed`.

6. Define a method to get the current location: This method tries to get the current location using the location manager. If location services are not enabled or the location is unavailable, it throws a `CustomError` of type `.dataUnavailable`.

7. Define a method to start tracking motion data: This method starts tracking accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data using the motion manager.

8. Define a method to stop tracking motion data: This method stops tracking accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data using the motion manager.

9. Define a method to pick an image from the photo library: This method presents an image picker controller to allow the user to pick an image from the photo library.

10. Create an instance of the class: This line creates an instance of the `ComplexFunctionality` class.

11. Example usage of the class methods: This code block shows how to use the class methods to play an audio file, get the current location, start/stop motion tracking, and pick an image from the photo library. It handles any potential errors that may occur during these operations.
