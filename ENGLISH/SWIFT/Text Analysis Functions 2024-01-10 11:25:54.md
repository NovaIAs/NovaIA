Explanation:

* The `stringToLowerAndLength` function takes a string as input and returns a tuple containing the string in lowercase and its length.
* The `stringsToLowerAndLengths` function takes a list of strings as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the lowercase strings and the values are the lengths of the strings.
* The `stringsGroupedByFirstCharacter` function takes a list of strings as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the first characters of the strings and the values are the number of strings that start with that character.
* The `stringsLongerThanLength` function takes a list of strings and a length as input and returns a list of the strings that are longer than the specified length.
* The `wordCounts` function takes a list of strings as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique words in the strings and the values are the number of times each word appears.
* The `mostCommonWords` function takes a list of strings and a count as input and returns a list of the most common words in the strings.

These functions can be used to perform a variety of text analysis tasks, such as finding the most common words in a document, grouping strings by their first character, and finding strings that are longer than a specified length.
