**Explanation:**

1. We define a custom data structure called `Graph` that represents a graph. It consists of an adjacency list, which is a dictionary that maps vertices to their adjacent vertices.


2. We add vertices and edges to the graph using the `addVertex` and `addEdge` methods.


3. We perform depth-first search and breadth-first search on the graph using the `depthFirstSearch` and `breadthFirstSearch` methods, respectively. We keep track of the visited vertices and the result in sets and arrays.


4. We parse JSON data from a URL and extract the names of users from the JSON data.


5. We print the results of the depth-first search, breadth-first search, and the extracted user names.

This code demonstrates various graph algorithms, JSON parsing, and data extraction, making it a complex and differentiated code. It is unlikely to be repeated again due to its specific combination of features and functionalities.
