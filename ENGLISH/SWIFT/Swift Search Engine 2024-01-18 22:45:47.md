// Sample usage:

let documents: [Document] = // Initialize a list of documents
searchEngine.index(documents)
let results = searchEngine.search("search query")
print(results) // Output: [URL1, URL2, ...]

// Explanation:

1. class SearchEngine: This declares a Swift class named SearchEngine that represents the search engine.
2. private let index: [String: Set<URL>]: This declares a private property called index within the SearchEngine class. It is a dictionary that maps words to a set of URLs.
3. init(): This is the initializer for the SearchEngine class. It initializes the index dictionary to be empty.
4. func index(_ documents: [Document]): This is a method that takes a list of documents as input and indexes their content.
5. for document in documents: This iterates over each document in the input list.
6. for word in document.words: This iterates over each word in the current document.
7. var urls = index[word, default: []]: This attempts to retrieve the set of URLs associated with the current word from the index dictionary. If the word is not present in the index, it initializes an empty set using the default value of [].
8. urls.insert(document.url): This adds the URL of the current document to the set of URLs associated with the current word.
9. index[word] = urls: This updates the index dictionary with the new set of URLs for the current word.
10. func search(_ query: String) -> Set<URL>: This is a method that takes a search query as input and returns a set of URLs that match the query.
11. var results: Set<URL> = []: This initializes an empty set of URLs to store the search results.
12. for word in query.components(separatedBy: " "): This splits the search query into individual words.
13. if let urls = index[word] { ... }: This checks if the current word is present in the index dictionary. If it is, it retrieves the set of URLs associated with the word and adds them to the results set.
14. return results: This returns the set of URLs that satisfy the search query.
15. let searchEngine = SearchEngine(): This creates an instance of the SearchEngine class.
16. let documents: [Document] = // Initialize a list of documents: This initializes a list of documents to index.
17. searchEngine.index(documents): This calls the index method on the search engine to index the provided documents.
18. let results = searchEngine.search("search query"): This calls the search method on the search engine with a sample search query.
19. print(results): This prints the set of URLs that match the search query.
