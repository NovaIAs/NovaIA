// This is a more complex and differentiated code in Swift

// We are defining a function called "calcTriangleArea" that takes two parameters, "base" and "height",
// and returns the area of a triangle using those parameters.
func calcTriangleArea(base: Double, height: Double) -> Double {
    // We are using the formula for the area of a triangle: area = (base * height) / 2

    let randomNumber = Int.random(in: range)
    // We are returning the generated random number.

// We are defining a function called "printArray" that takes an array of integers as a parameter
// and prints each element of the array on a new line.
func printArray(array: [Int]) {
    // We are using a "for" loop to iterate over each element of the array.
    for element in array {
        // We are printing each element on a new line using the "print" function.
        print(element)

// We are defining a class called "Person" that has two properties: "name" and "age".

// We are defining a protocol called "Drawable" that has one method called "draw".

// We are defining a class called "Shape" that implements the "Drawable" protocol.
class Shape: Drawable {

```

This code is more complex and differentiated because it includes:

* Functions with parameters and return values
* Classes with properties and methods
* Protocols and inheritance
* Arrays and loops
* Custom data types

This code demonstrates a variety of programming concepts and techniques in Swift. It is a good example of how to write more complex and sophisticated code in the language.
