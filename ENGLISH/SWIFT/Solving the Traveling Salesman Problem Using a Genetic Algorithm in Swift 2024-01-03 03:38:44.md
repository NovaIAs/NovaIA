        self.mutationRate = mutationRate
        self.maxGenerations = maxGenerations
    }

// Example usage

    City(name: "C", x: 3.0, y: 3.0),

    City(name: "E", x: 5.0, y: 5.0)
]

let geneticAlgorithm = GeneticAlgorithm(cities: cities, populationSize: 1000, mutationRate: 0.01, maxGenerations: 100)
let result = geneticAlgorithm.solveTSP()

print("Optimal tour:")
for city in result {
    print(city.name)
}
```

This code implements the genetic algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem. The problem involves finding the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting city.

The `City` struct represents each city with its name, x-coordinate, and y-coordinate. The `GeneticAlgorithm` class encapsulates the entire algorithm. It takes inputs such as the list of cities, population size, mutation rate, and maximum number of generations.

The `solveTSP()` function is the main entry point for solving the problem. It initializes the population, iterates through generations, selects parents, performs crossover and mutation operations, and finally returns the best individual from the final generation.

The code also includes helper functions like `generatePopulation()`, `calculateFitness()`, `calculateTotalDistance()`, `calculateDistance()`, `selectParent()`, `crossover()`, and `mutate()` to perform various operations involved in the genetic algorithm.

In the example usage section, a set of cities is defined, and the genetic algorithm is instantiated with specific parameter values. Then, the `solveTSP()` function is called to obtain the optimal tour. The result is printed, displaying the order in which the cities should be visited to minimize the total distance traveled.
