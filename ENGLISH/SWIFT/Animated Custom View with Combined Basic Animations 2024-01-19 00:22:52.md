        // Add the animated view to the view controller's view
        view.addSubview(animatedView)
        
        // Start the animation
        animatedView.startAnimation()
    }
    
    // Create an override of the viewDidDisappear method
    override func viewDidDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {

    }
}
```

Explanation:

* The code imports the necessary libraries: `Foundation` and `UIKit`.
* It defines a custom `UIView` subclass called `AnimatedView`.
* The `AnimatedView` class has a private variable called `animationDuration` to store the duration of the animation and a private variable called `animationOptions` to store the animation options.
* It has a public method called `startAnimation()` which creates a basic animation that moves the view up and down and a basic animation that fades the view in and out. It then creates an animation group that combines the two basic animations and adds it to the view's layer.
* It also has a public method called `stopAnimation()` which removes the animation group from the view's layer.
* The code then creates a class called `ViewController` which demonstrates the usage of the `AnimatedView` class.
* The `ViewController` class has a private variable called `animatedView` to store the animated view.
* It creates an override of the `viewDidLoad` method which creates an instance of the `AnimatedView` class, adds it to the view controller's view, and starts the animation.
* It also creates an override of the `viewDidDisappear` method which stops the animation.

This code demonstrates how to create a custom view that animates using a combination of basic animations. It can be used to create various types of animations, such as fading, moving, and rotating views.
