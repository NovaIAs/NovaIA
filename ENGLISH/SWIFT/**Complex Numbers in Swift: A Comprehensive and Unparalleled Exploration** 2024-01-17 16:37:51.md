Here is a complex and differentiated code in Swift that is unlikely to be repeated again:

```
class ComplexNumber {
    var real: Double
    var imaginary: Double

    init(real: Double, imaginary: Double) {
        self.real = real
        self.imaginary = imaginary
    }

    func add(other: ComplexNumber) -> ComplexNumber {
        return ComplexNumber(real: real + other.real, imaginary: imaginary + other.imaginary)
    }

    func subtract(other: ComplexNumber) -> ComplexNumber {
        return ComplexNumber(real: real - other.real, imaginary: imaginary - other.imaginary)
    }

    func multiply(other: ComplexNumber) -> ComplexNumber {
        var product = ComplexNumber(real: 0, imaginary: 0)
        product.real = real * other.real - imaginary * other.imaginary
        product.imaginary = real * other.imaginary + imaginary * other.real
        return product
    }

    func divide(other: ComplexNumber) -> ComplexNumber {
        var quotient = ComplexNumber(real: 0, imaginary: 0)
        let denominator = other.real * other.real + other.imaginary * other.imaginary
        quotient.real = (real * other.real + imaginary * other.imaginary) / denominator
        quotient.imaginary = (imaginary * other.real - real * other.imaginary) / denominator
        return quotient
    }

    func conjugate() -> ComplexNumber {
        return ComplexNumber(real: real, imaginary: -imaginary)
    }

    func absoluteValue() -> Double {
        return sqrt(real * real + imaginary * imaginary)
    }

    func argument() -> Double {
        return atan2(imaginary, real)
    }
}

// Testing the ComplexNumber class
let num1 = ComplexNumber(real: 3.0, imaginary: 4.0)
let num2 = ComplexNumber(real: 5.0, imaginary: -2.0)

let sum = num1.add(other: num2)
let difference = num1.subtract(other: num2)
let product = num1.multiply(other: num2)
let quotient = num1.divide(other: num2)
let conjugate = num1.conjugate()
let absoluteValue = num1.absoluteValue()
let argument = num1.argument()

print("Sum: \(sum.real) + \(sum.imaginary)i")
print("Difference: \(difference.real) + \(difference.imaginary)i")
print("Product: \(product.real) + \(product.imaginary)i")
print("Quotient: \(quotient.real) + \(quotient.imaginary)i")
print("Conjugate: \(conjugate.real) + \(conjugate.imaginary)i")
print("Absolute Value: \(absoluteValue)")
print("Argument: \(argument)")

```

This code defines a complex number class in Swift, along with a variety of methods for performing mathematical operations on complex numbers. It includes methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, conjugation, absolute value, and argument. It also includes a main function to test the class and demonstrate its use.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `ComplexNumber` Class: This class represents a complex number with real and imaginary parts.

2. `init` Method: The constructor initializes a `ComplexNumber` object with the specified real and imaginary parts.

3. Mathematical Operation Methods: These methods implement various mathematical operations on complex numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

4. `conjugate` Method: This method returns the conjugate of the complex number, which is a complex number with the same real part and the imaginary part negated.

5. `absoluteValue` Method: This method calculates the absolute value of the complex number, which is the magnitude or length of the complex number.

6. `argument` Method: This method calculates the argument of the complex number, which is the angle between the positive real axis and the line connecting the complex number to the origin in the complex plane.

7. `main` Function: This function creates two `ComplexNumber` objects and demonstrates the use of the class methods by performing various mathematical operations and displaying the results.

This code showcases complex number operations in Swift and demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming to model and perform mathematical calculations on complex numbers. It's designed to be complex and differentiated, making it unlikely to be repeated again.
