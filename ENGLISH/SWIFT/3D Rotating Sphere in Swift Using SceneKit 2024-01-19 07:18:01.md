// Define a custom view controller class that inherits from the base UIViewController class

    // Declare instance variables
    var sceneView: SCNView!

        // Create a new SceneKit view and add it to the view controller's view
        sceneView = SCNView(frame: self.view.bounds)
        sceneView.autoresizingMask = [.flexibleWidth, .flexibleHeight]
        self.view.addSubview(sceneView)

        // Create a new SCNScene and set it as the scene for the SceneKit view
        scene = SCNScene()
        sceneView.scene = scene

        // Create a camera node and add it to the scene

        cameraNode.position = SCNVector3(x: 0, y: 0, z: 10)
        scene.rootNode.addChildNode(cameraNode)

        // Create a light node and add it to the scene

        // Create an animation to rotate the sphere
        let rotationAnimation = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "rotation")
        rotationAnimation.toValue = NSValue(scnVector4: SCNVector4(x: 0, y: 1, z: 0, w: Float(2 * Double.pi)))
        rotationAnimation.duration = 2.0

    }
}
```

This code creates a simple 3D scene in Swift using SceneKit. It sets up a camera and light, and then creates a rotating sphere in the scene. The code is well-commented and easy to understand, even if you're new to Swift or SceneKit.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

* The `ComplexViewController` class inherits from the `UIViewController` class, which is the base class for all view controllers in UIKit.
* The `viewDidLoad()` method is called when the view controller's view is first loaded. This is where we set up the scene and add the sphere to it.
* We create a new `SCNView` and add it to the view controller's view. This is the view that will display the 3D scene.
* We create a new `SCNScene` and set it as the scene for the `SCNView`. This is the 3D scene that we'll be working with.
* We create a camera node and a light node, and add them to the scene. The camera node is used to view the scene, and the light node provides lighting for the scene.
* We create a sphere geometry object and add it to the scene. This is the object that we'll be rotating.
* We create an animation to rotate the sphere, and add it to the sphere node. This animation will cause the sphere to rotate continuously.

When you run this code, you'll see a 3D scene with a rotating sphere. You can move the camera around the scene by dragging your finger on the screen.
