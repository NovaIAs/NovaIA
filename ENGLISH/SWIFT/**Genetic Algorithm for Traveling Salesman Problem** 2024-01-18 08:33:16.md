// This is a very large and differentiated code in Swift. It is unlikely to be repeated again.

// It is a program that implements the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a genetic algorithm.
// The TSP is a classic optimization problem in which a salesman must visit a set of cities in a given order, visiting each city exactly once and returning to the starting city, so as to minimize the total distance traveled.

// The program uses a genetic algorithm to find a solution to the TSP.
// A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection.
// It starts with a population of random solutions and iteratively applies genetic operators (crossover and mutation) to evolve the population towards better solutions.

// Here is a brief explanation of the code:

// 1. The `City` struct represents a city with a name and a location (x and y coordinates).

// 2. The `Tour` struct represents a tour, which is a sequence of cities visited by the salesman.
// The `fitness()` method calculates the total distance of the tour.

// 3. The `GeneticAlgorithm` class implements the genetic algorithm.
// It starts with a population of random tours and iteratively applies genetic operators to evolve the population towards better tours.
// The `select()` method selects the best tours from the population based on their fitness.
// The `crossover()` method creates new tours by combining the genes of two parent tours.
// The `mutate()` method randomly changes some genes in a tour.

// 4. The `main()` function creates a new `GeneticAlgorithm` object and runs it to find a solution to the TSP.
// It then prints the best tour found by the algorithm.

// This code is complex and contains many different concepts.
// It is a good example of how genetic algorithms can be used to solve optimization problems.

// Here are some additional details about the code:

// * The `populationSize` variable specifies the size of the population.
// * The `mutationRate` variable specifies the probability that a gene will be mutated.
// * The `maxIterations` variable specifies the maximum number of iterations the algorithm will run.
// * The `cities` variable contains a list of all the cities to be visited by the salesman.
// * The `distances` variable contains a matrix of distances between all pairs of cities.

// The code uses the following genetic operators:

// * Crossover: Two parent tours are selected and a new tour is created by combining the genes of the two parents.
// * Mutation: A random gene in a tour is changed.

// The code uses the following selection method:

// * Roulette wheel selection: Each tour is assigned a probability of being selected based on its fitness.
// The higher the fitness, the higher the probability of being selected.

// The code uses the following fitness function:

// * Total distance: The total distance of the tour is calculated by summing the distances between consecutive cities.

// The code uses the following stopping criterion:

// * Maximum number of iterations: The algorithm stops after a specified number of iterations.

// The code prints the following information:

// * The best tour found by the algorithm
// * The total distance of the best tour
