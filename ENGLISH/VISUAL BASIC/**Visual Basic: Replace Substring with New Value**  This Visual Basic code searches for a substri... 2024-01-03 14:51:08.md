```visual basic (make me a very large and differentiated code, which will hardly be repeated again. the code has to be in english. please explain the code)

        ' If the substring matches the comparison string, replace it with the new value.
        If strComparison = "Old Value" Then
            If blnFound = False Then
                strOutput = Left(strInput, intIndex - Len(strDelimiter) + 1) & strNewValue & Right(strInput, Len(strInput) - intIndex)

    Loop

    ' If the comparison string was not found, add it to the end of the output string.

    TextBox2.Text = strOutput
End Sub

' This code searches for a substring in a string and replaces it with a new value.
' The code uses the InStr function to find the delimiter, and the Mid function to extract the substring.
' The code also uses the Left, Right, and Len functions to manipulate the strings.
