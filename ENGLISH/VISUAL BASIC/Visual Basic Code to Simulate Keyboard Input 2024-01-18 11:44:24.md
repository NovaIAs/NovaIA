This code simulates keyboard input in Visual Basic. It uses the WScript.Shell object to send keystrokes to the active window. The code first defines the string of characters to be typed, then loops through each character and sends the corresponding keystroke. If the character is a letter, the code also presses and releases the shift key to ensure that it is typed in uppercase.

To use the code, simply replace the string of characters in the "keys" variable with the text that you want to type. Then, call the "SimulateKeyboardInput" subroutine to send the keystrokes to the active window.
