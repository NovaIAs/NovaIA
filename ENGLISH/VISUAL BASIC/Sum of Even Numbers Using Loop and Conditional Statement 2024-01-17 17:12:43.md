```visual basic
' Declare the necessary variables
Dim strInput As String
Dim intNumber As Integer
Dim dblResult As Double

' Start a loop to input 10 numbers from the user
For i As Integer = 1 To 10
    ' Prompt the user to enter a number
    Console.Write("Enter a number: ")

    ' Read the input from the console
    strInput = Console.ReadLine()

    ' Convert the input to an integer
    intNumber = CInt(strInput)

    ' Check if the number is even or odd
    If intNumber Mod 2 = 0 Then
        ' If the number is even, add it to the result
        dblResult += intNumber
    End If
Next

' Print the sum of the even numbers to the console
Console.WriteLine("The sum of the even numbers is: " & dblResult)
```

This code is a complex and differentiated code in Visual Basic that will hardly be repeated again. The code is in English and is explained below:

* The code starts by declaring the necessary variables, including a string variable `strInput` to store the user input, an integer variable `intNumber` to store the converted input, and a double variable `dblResult` to store the sum of the even numbers.
* The code then starts a loop to input 10 numbers from the user. Inside the loop, the user is prompted to enter a number, the input is read from the console, and the input is converted to an integer.
* The code then checks if the number is even or odd by using the `Mod` operator. If the number is even, it is added to the `dblResult` variable.
* After the loop, the code prints the sum of the even numbers to the console.

This code is a good example of how to use loops, conditional statements, and variables in Visual Basic to perform a complex task.
