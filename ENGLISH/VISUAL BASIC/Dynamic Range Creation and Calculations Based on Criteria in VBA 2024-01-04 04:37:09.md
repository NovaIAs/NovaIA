' VBA Code to Create a Dynamic Range Based on Criteria and Perform Calculations
' This code demonstrates how to create a dynamic range based on criteria and perform calculations on the data within that range.

' Declare variables
Dim rngData As Range
Dim rngFiltered As Range
Dim rngCriteria As Range
Dim criteria As Variant
Dim sumValue As Double

' Get the data range
Set rngData = Range("A1:D10")

' Get the criteria range
Set rngCriteria = Range("E1:E5")

' Define the criteria
criteria = rngCriteria.Value

' Create a dynamic range based on the criteria
Set rngFiltered = rngData.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible)

' Calculate the sum of values in the filtered range
sumValue = Application.Sum(rngFiltered)

' Display the sum value
MsgBox "The sum of values in the filtered range is " & sumValue

' Display the filtered range
rngFiltered.Select

' Explanation of the code:
' 1. We first declare variables to store the data range, filtered range, criteria range, criteria, and sum value.
' 2. We use Range("A1:D10") to get the data range.
' 3. We use Range("E1:E5") to get the criteria range.
' 4. We use rngCriteria.Value to extract the criteria values from the criteria range.
' 5. We use rngData.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible) to create a dynamic range based on the criteria. This step filters the data range based on the criteria.
' 6. We use Application.Sum(rngFiltered) to calculate the sum of values in the filtered range.
' 7. We use MsgBox to display the sum value.
' 8. Finally, we use rngFiltered.Select to select the filtered range.
