Explanation:

This code performs a complex and differentiated set of operations to process a given input string:

1. It first removes excluded characters, such as punctuation marks, from the input string.

2. The cleaned string is then reversed.

3. The reversed string is formatted with proper capitalization and punctuation.

4. The formatted string is split into an array of words.

5. A dictionary is created to store the frequency of each word.

6. The dictionary is sorted by word frequency in descending order using the Quick Sort algorithm.

7. A formatted list of words along with their frequencies is constructed.

8. Finally, the formatted word list is displayed in a message box.

This code demonstrates advanced string manipulation, data structures, and sorting algorithms in a single comprehensive implementation.
