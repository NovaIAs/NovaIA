This code contains several complex mathematical functions written in Visual Basic. Let's break down each function and explain its purpose:

1. **Factorial Function:**
   - Calculates the factorial of a given number.
   - The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers from 1 to that number.
   - For example, the factorial of 5 (5!) is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.

2. **Fibonacci Function:**
   - Calculates the nth Fibonacci number.
   - The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1.
   - For example, the Fibonacci sequence starts as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... and so on.

3. **PrimeFactors Function:**
   - Returns a collection of the prime factors of a given number.
   - A prime factor is a prime number that divides the given number without leaving a remainder.
   - For example, the prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3, since 12 = 2 x 2 x 3.

4. **GCD Function:**
   - Calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
   - The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.
   - For example, the GCD of 12 and 18 is 6, since 6 divides both 12 and 18 without leaving a remainder.

5. **LCM Function:**
   - Calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.
   - For example, the LCM of 12 and 18 is 36, since 36 is the smallest positive integer divisible by both 12 and 18.

6. **IsPrime Function:**
   - Checks if a given number is prime.
   - A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - For example, 13 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 13.

7. **NextPrime Function:**
   - Returns the next prime number after a given number.
   - This function is useful for generating prime numbers or working with prime numbers in a sequence.
