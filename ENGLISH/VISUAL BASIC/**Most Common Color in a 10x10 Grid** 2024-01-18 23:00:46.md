**Explanation:**

This code generates a 10x10 grid of random colors and then finds the most common color in the grid.

1. The code first defines the constants used in the program, including the number of rows and columns in the grid, the number of colors, and the arrays to store the colors and their RGB values.


2. The `colorNames` and `rgbValues` arrays are initialized with the names and RGB values of the colors.


3. The `colors` array is initialized with random colors using the `Rnd` function.


4. The colors in the grid are displayed using a nested loop.


5. The most common color in the grid is found by iterating through the grid and counting the number of times each color appears. The color with the highest count is the most common color.


6. The most common color is displayed using the `Debug.Print` statement.
