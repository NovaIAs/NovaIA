Here is a more complex and differentiated Visual Basic code that is unlikely to be repeated again:

This code defines a custom class called `ComplexNumber` that represents complex numbers in the form `a + bi`, where `a` and `b` are real numbers and `i` is the imaginary unit. The class includes properties for the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, as well as several methods for performing operations on complex numbers.

```visual basic

Public Class ComplexNumber
    Private _real As Double
    Private _imaginary As Double

    Public Property Real() As Double
        Get
            Return _real
        End Get
        Set(value As Double)
            _real = value
        End Set
    End Property

    Public Property Imaginary() As Double
        Get
            Return _imaginary
        End Get
        Set(value As Double)
            _imaginary = value
        End Set
    End Property

    Public Sub New(real As Double, imaginary As Double)
        _real = real
        _imaginary = imaginary
    End Sub

    Public Function Add(other As ComplexNumber) As ComplexNumber
        Dim result As New ComplexNumber(_real + other.Real, _imaginary + other.Imaginary)
        Return result
    End Function

    Public Function Subtract(other As ComplexNumber) As ComplexNumber
        Dim result As New ComplexNumber(_real - other.Real, _imaginary - other.Imaginary)
        Return result
    End Function

    Public Function Multiply(other As ComplexNumber) As ComplexNumber
        Dim result As New ComplexNumber(
            _real * other.Real - _imaginary * other.Imaginary,
            _real * other.Imaginary + _imaginary * other.Real
        )
        Return result
    End Function

    Public Function Divide(other As ComplexNumber) As ComplexNumber
        If other.Real = 0 AndAlso other.Imaginary = 0 Then
            Throw New DivideByZeroException("Cannot divide by zero.")
        End If

        Dim denominator As Double = other.Real * other.Real + other.Imaginary * other.Imaginary
        Dim result As New ComplexNumber(
            (_real * other.Real + _imaginary * other.Imaginary) / denominator,
            (_imaginary * other.Real - _real * other.Imaginary) / denominator
        )
        Return result
    End Function

    Public Function ToString() As String
        Return String.Format("{0} + {1}i", _real, _imaginary)
    End Function
End Class

Public Sub Main()
    Dim complexNumber1 As New ComplexNumber(3, 4)
    Dim complexNumber2 As New ComplexNumber(5, -2)

    Dim sum As ComplexNumber = complexNumber1.Add(complexNumber2)
    Dim difference As ComplexNumber = complexNumber1.Subtract(complexNumber2)
    Dim product As ComplexNumber = complexNumber1.Multiply(complexNumber2)
    Dim quotient As ComplexNumber = complexNumber1.Divide(complexNumber2)

    Console.WriteLine("Sum: {0}", sum.ToString())
    Console.WriteLine("Difference: {0}", difference.ToString())
    Console.WriteLine("Product: {0}", product.ToString())
    Console.WriteLine("Quotient: {0}", quotient.ToString())
End Sub
```

This code also includes a `Main` method that creates two instances of the `ComplexNumber` class and then uses the methods defined in the class to perform various operations on them. The results of these operations are printed to the console.

This code is quite complex and includes a number of different features, such as custom classes, properties, methods, and operators. It also demonstrates the use of exception handling to prevent division by zero errors.

Overall, this code is a good example of how Visual Basic can be used to create complex and sophisticated applications.
