A very large and differentiated code in VISUAL BASIC that will hardly be repeated again. The code includes:

- Variables of different types (string, integer, double, boolean)
- Calculations
- Arrays
- Dictionaries
- Functions
- Subroutines
- Classes
- Forms

The code is explained in detail in the comments.
