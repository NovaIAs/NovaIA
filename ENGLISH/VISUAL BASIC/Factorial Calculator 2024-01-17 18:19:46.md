This program uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number. The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number.

The program starts by declaring the function that will calculate the factorial. The function is named Factorial and takes an integer parameter.

The function then checks if the parameter is less than or equal to 1. If it is, then the function returns 1. This is because the factorial of 1 is 1.

If the parameter is greater than 1, then the function calculates the factorial of the parameter by multiplying the parameter by the factorial of the parameter minus 1. The function then returns this value.

The main sub of the program then declares a variable to store the number for which we want to calculate the factorial. The main sub then gets the number from the user and calls the Factorial function to calculate the factorial of the number.

The main sub then displays the factorial of the number to the console.
