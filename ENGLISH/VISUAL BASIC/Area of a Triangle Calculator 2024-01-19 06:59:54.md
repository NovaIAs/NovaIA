```visual basic
' This program calculates the area of a triangle.

' Declare the variables.
Dim base As Double
Dim height As Double
Dim area As Double

' Get the input from the user.
Console.WriteLine("Enter the base of the triangle:")
base = Double.Parse(Console.ReadLine())
Console.WriteLine("Enter the height of the triangle:")
height = Double.Parse(Console.ReadLine())

' Calculate the area of the triangle.
area = 0.5 * base * height

' Display the result.
Console.WriteLine("The area of the triangle is {0} square units.", area)
```

This code is a bit more complex than the previous ones. It includes comments to explain what each part of the code does. It also uses the `Double.Parse()` method to convert the user's input from a string to a double. This is necessary because the `base` and `height` variables are declared as doubles.

The code also uses the `Console.WriteLine()` method to display the result. This method can be used to display text on the console.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The `Dim` statements declare the variables used in the program.
* The `Console.WriteLine()` statements display the prompts for the user to enter the base and height of the triangle.
* The `Double.Parse()` method converts the user's input from a string to a double.
* The `area` variable is calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle.
* The `Console.WriteLine()` statement displays the result.
