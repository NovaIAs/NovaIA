Explanation:

* The Stock class represents a stock and contains properties for name, symbol, and prices.
* The AnalysisResults class stores the results of the analysis and contains properties for stocks and trends.
* The Trend class represents a trend and contains properties for name and stocks.
* The LoadStockData function loads the stock data from a file and returns a list of stocks.
* The PerformCorrelationAnalysis function performs a correlation analysis on the stock data and returns a list of trends.
* The CalculateCorrelation function calculates the correlation between two lists of numbers.
* The PerformRegressionAnalysis function performs a regression analysis on the stock data and returns a list of trends.
* The CalculateRegression function calculates the regression of a list of numbers.
* The PrintResults function prints the results of the analysis to the console.
* The Main function is the entry point of the program and calls the other functions to perform the analysis and print the results.
