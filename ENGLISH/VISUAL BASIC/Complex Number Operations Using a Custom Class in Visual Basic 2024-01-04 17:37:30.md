This code demonstrates a custom class called "ComplexNumber" that represents complex numbers with real and imaginary parts. It includes properties to get and set these parts, as well as overloaded operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers. The code also includes a module to test the "ComplexNumber" class by performing various operations on an array of complex numbers and displaying the results.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Custom Class "ComplexNumber"**:
   - The "ComplexNumber" class is defined to represent complex numbers.
   - It has private fields for the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.
   - It provides properties to get and set these parts.
   - It overloads the "+", "-", "*", and "/" operators to perform complex number operations.
   - It overrides the "ToString" method to display the complex number in the format "a + bi".

2. **Module "Module1"**:
   - An array of complex numbers is declared and initialized.
   - A loop is used to iterate through the array and display each complex number.
   - Various complex number operations are performed using the overloaded operators.
   - The results of the operations are displayed.
   - The console window is kept open until a key is pressed.

This code demonstrates the use of a custom class to represent complex numbers and perform various operations on them. It showcases the use of overloaded operators and the "ToString" method to customize the output of the class.
