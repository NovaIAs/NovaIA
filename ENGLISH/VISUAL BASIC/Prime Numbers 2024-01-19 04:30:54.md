This code first defines a function called `IsPrime` that checks if a given number is prime. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

The `IsPrime` function uses a loop to check if the number is divisible by any of the numbers from 2 to its square root. If the number is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime. Otherwise, it is prime.

The `PrintPrimeNumbers` subroutine then uses the `IsPrime` function to print all the prime numbers up to a specified upper limit.

The `PrintPrimeNumbers` subroutine first prints a header, and then loops through all the numbers from 1 to the upper limit. For each number, it calls the `IsPrime` function to check if the number is prime. If the number is prime, it is printed.

Finally, the `PrintPrimeNumbers` subroutine is called to print the prime numbers up to 100.
