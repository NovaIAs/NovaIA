This code first declares the function that will calculate the factorial. The function takes a single argument, which is the number to calculate the factorial of. The function returns a Long integer, which is a 64-bit integer.

The function initializes the factorial variable to 1. This is because the factorial of 0 is 1. The function then loops through the numbers from 1 to the given number, multiplying each number by the previous one. This is how the factorial is calculated.

After the loop, the function returns the factorial of the given number.

The main part of the code gets the number from the user, calls the function to calculate the factorial of the given number, and then displays the factorial of the given number.

The code uses the Console class to get input from the user and to display output to the user. The Console class is part of the System namespace, which is a collection of classes that are used to perform common tasks in Visual Basic.

The code also uses the For loop to loop through the numbers from 1 to the given number. The For loop is a loop that is used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. The For loop is started with the For keyword, followed by the loop variable (i in this case), the starting value of the loop variable (1 in this case), the ending value of the loop variable (number in this case), and the step size of the loop variable (1 in this case). The block of code that is to be repeated is placed after the For loop keyword.

The code also uses the ReadKey method to keep the console window open until the user presses a key. The ReadKey method is part of the Console class. The ReadKey method waits for the user to press a key and then returns the key that was pressed.
