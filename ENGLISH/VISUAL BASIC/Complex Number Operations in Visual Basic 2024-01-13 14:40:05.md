Explanation:

This Visual Basic code defines a custom class called `ComplexNumber` to represent complex numbers. The class has two private fields, `mReal` and `mImaginary`, to store the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively.

The class has several properties and methods to perform operations on complex numbers. The properties `Real` and `Imaginary` allow you to get and set the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

The methods `Add`, `Subtract`, `Multiply`, and `Divide` perform the corresponding operations on two complex numbers. The `ToString` method overrides the default `ToString` method to return a string representation of the complex number in the format "(real, imaginary)".

In the main part of the code, two complex numbers `c1` and `c2` are created. Then, the operations `Add`, `Subtract`, `Multiply`, and `Divide` are performed on these two complex numbers, and the results are stored in the variables `c3`, `c4`, `c5`, and `c6`, respectively.

Finally, the results are displayed to the console using the `Console.WriteLine` method.
