This code defines a class called `Polynomial` that represents a polynomial. The class has a constructor that takes an array of coefficients as an argument and a method called `Evaluate` that evaluates the polynomial at a given value of x. The class also has a method called `FindRoots` that finds the roots of the polynomial using Newton's method.

The code then defines a function called `GenerateRandomPolynomial` that generates a random polynomial with a given degree. The function creates an array of coefficients for the polynomial and then generates random coefficients for the polynomial. The function then returns the polynomial.

The code then defines a function called `TestPolynomial` that tests the `Polynomial` class. The function generates a random polynomial with degree 5 and then evaluates the polynomial at a few different values of x. The function then finds the roots of the polynomial and prints them to the console.

The code then calls the `TestPolynomial` function to test the `Polynomial` class.
