Explanation:

1. The `GenerateFibonacciSequence` subroutine takes two arguments: `n`, which specifies the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate, and `fibonacciSequence`, which is a variant that will store the generated sequence.

2. Inside the subroutine, the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (0 and 1) are initialized.

3. A `For` loop is used to iterate over the remaining numbers in the sequence, starting from the third number.

4. For each iteration of the loop, the next number in the sequence is calculated by adding the previous two numbers together.

5. The `PrintFibonacciSequence` subroutine takes the generated Fibonacci sequence as an argument and prints it to the console.

6. Inside the subroutine, a `For` loop is used to iterate over the sequence and print each number on a new line.

7. The `Main` subroutine is the entry point of the program.

8. Inside the `Main` subroutine, a variant is declared to store the Fibonacci sequence.

9. The `GenerateFibonacciSequence` subroutine is called to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the 20th number.

10. The `PrintFibonacciSequence` subroutine is called to print the generated sequence to the console.
