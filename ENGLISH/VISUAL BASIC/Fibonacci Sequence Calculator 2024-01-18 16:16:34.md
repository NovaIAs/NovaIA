Explanation:

The above code calculates the Fibonacci sequence using a recursive function named fib. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1.

Function Definition:

Public Function fib(n As Integer) As Long
This line defines a public function named fib that takes an integer argument n and returns a long integer (a 64-bit integer).

Code Inside the Function:

If n < 2 Then
fib = n
This is the base case of the recursion. If n is less than 2, the function immediately returns the value of n.

Else
fib = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
If n is not less than 2, the function calls itself recursively with n - 1 and n - 2 as arguments. It then adds the results of these recursive calls to compute the nth Fibonacci number.

End If
This line ends the if-else block.

Calling the Function:

In the Main() subroutine, the code calls the fib function with different values of n and prints the results to the console.

For i As Integer = 0 To n
This line starts a loop that iterates from 0 to n.

Console.WriteLine("Fib({0}) = {1}", i, fib(i))
Inside the loop, the code uses the Console.WriteLine method to print the Fibonacci number for each value of i. The placeholders {0} and {1} are replaced with the values of i and fib(i), respectively.

End Sub
This line marks the end of the Main() subroutine.

The code continues to execute, calculating and printing the Fibonacci numbers for the specified range.
