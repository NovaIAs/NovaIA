This program is a simple calendar that allows the user to view the current date and navigate through the months and years. The program uses loops, arrays, and conditional statements to keep track of the current date and to respond to the user's input.

The program starts by declaring an array to store the names of the months and an array to store the number of days in each month. It then declares variables to store the current month, day, and year.

The program then enters a loop that runs until the user enters "quit". In each iteration of the loop, the program displays the current date and prompts the user to enter a command. The user can enter "next" to move to the next day, "previous" to move to the previous day, or "quit" to exit the program.

The program uses a Select Case statement to check the user's input. If the user enters "next", the program moves to the next day. If the user enters "previous", the program moves to the previous day. If the user enters "quit", the program exits.

The program also checks if the current day is greater than the number of days in the current month. If it is, the program moves to the next month. The program also checks if the current month is greater than 12. If it is, the program moves to the next year.

The program also checks if the current day is less than 1. If it is, the program moves to the previous month. The program also checks if the current month is less than 1. If it is, the program moves to the previous year.

Finally, the program displays a message to the user and exits.
