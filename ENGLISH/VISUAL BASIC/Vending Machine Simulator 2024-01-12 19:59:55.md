This program simulates a simple vending machine. It allows the user to select a product from a list of available products and then insert money to purchase the product. The program keeps track of the user's balance and provides change if necessary.

The program is written in Visual Basic and uses the following features:

* **Arrays:** The `products` and `prices` arrays are used to store the list of available products and their prices.
* **While loops:** The `While True` loop is used to repeatedly prompt the user for input until they quit the program.
* **If statements:** The `If` statements are used to check the user's input and take appropriate action.
* **Console input and output:** The `Console.WriteLine()` and `Console.ReadLine()` methods are used to display messages to the user and get input from the user.

The program works as follows:

1. The user is prompted to select a product from the list of available products.
2. If the user enters a valid product number, the program prompts the user to insert money.
3. If the user enters an amount of money that is greater than or equal to the price of the selected product, the program dispenses the product and provides change if necessary.
4. If the user enters an amount of money that is less than the price of the selected product, the program displays an error message.
5. The program repeats steps 1-4 until the user quits the program.
