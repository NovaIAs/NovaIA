**Explanation:**

1. **Variable Declarations:**
   - Utilize various data types to declare variables such as strings for names, integers for age, doubles for salaries, and Booleans for status.

2. **Custom Function:**
   - Create a function to calculate gross salary based on base salary and bonus, returning the result.

3. **Array Iterations:**
   - Utilize "For Each" loops to iterate through an array of employee names and display them.

4. **Multidimensional Array:**
   - Create and populate a multidimensional array with employee details, then iterate through it using nested loops to retrieve and display the data.

5. **Custom Class:**
   - Define a class to represent an employee, with properties for name, age, and salary. A constructor is included to initialize the properties and a method to calculate gross salary with an additional bonus.

6. **Class Instance:**
   - Create an instance of the Employee class and use its method to calculate and display the gross salary with a bonus.

7. **Loop with Calculations:**
   - Use a loop to iterate through a range of numbers, calculating and displaying the square of each number.

8. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement a custom error handler to catch and display an error message if an exception occurs.

This code demonstrates complex programming techniques, including custom functions, array iterations, multidimensional arrays, class definitions, and error handling, making it a comprehensive example of Visual Basic coding.
