Explanation:

1. **GetLargestPrimeFactor Function**:

 - **Input**: A positive integer `number`.

 - **Purpose**: Finds and returns the largest prime factor of the given `number`.


2. **main Sub**:

 - **Initialize Variables**:
   
   - `number`: Stores the input number for which we want to find the largest prime factor.

   - `largestPrimeFactor`: Stores the largest prime factor of `number`.


3. **Call GetLargestPrimeFactor Function**:

 - We pass the `number` as an argument to the `GetLargestPrimeFactor` function and store the returned value in the `largestPrimeFactor` variable.


4. **Display the Result**:

 - We use the `Debug.Print` statement to display the largest prime factor of the input number.


5. **Working of the `GetLargestPrimeFactor` Function**:

 - We start the `Do While` loop with `number > 1` as the condition, which means it will continue until the `number` becomes 1.


 - We use a variable `i` to iterate through potential prime factors. Initially, we set `i` to 2 because 2 is the smallest prime number.


 - Inside the loop, we check if `number` is divisible by `i` using the `number Mod i = 0` condition. If it is, it means we have found a prime factor of `number`.


 - We update `largestPrimeFactor` with the current value of `i` because it is a prime factor of `number`.


 - We then divide `number` by `i` to remove the prime factor and continue checking for prime factors of the remaining number.


 - After finding a prime factor, we restart the iteration from 2 to check for the next prime factor.


 - The loop continues until there are no more prime factors, at which point `number` will become 1 and the loop will exit.


 - Finally, we return the `largestPrimeFactor` as the result, which represents the largest prime factor of the input `number`.
