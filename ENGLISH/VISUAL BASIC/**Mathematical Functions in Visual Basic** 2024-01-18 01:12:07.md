This code demonstrates several complex and interesting mathematical functions in Visual Basic:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The `GetFibonacci` function calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

2. **Prime Factorization**: The `GetPrimeFactors` function finds all the prime factors of a given number.

3. **Greatest Common Divisor**: The `GetGreatestCommonDivisor` function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

4. **Least Common Multiple**: The `GetLeastCommonMultiple` function calculates the least common multiple of two numbers using the greatest common divisor.

5. **Collatz Sequence**: The `GetCollatzSequence` function generates the Collatz sequence for a given starting number.

6. **Palindrome Check**: The `IsPalindrome` function checks if a given number is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

7. **Digit Sum**: The `GetDigitSum` function calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.
