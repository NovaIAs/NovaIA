**Explanation:**

This code demonstrates the use of regular expressions in Visual Basic to find various patterns in a given input string. The input string is:

```
This is a sample input string with various patterns.
```

The code uses several regular expressions to find different patterns in the input string, such as:

* Words with at least 3 consecutive vowels
* Numbers
* Words with at least one digit
* Duplicate words
* Palindromes
* Words with digits at the start and end

The code uses the `Regex` class to create and use regular expressions. The `Matches` method of the `Regex` class is used to find all matches of a regular expression in a string. The matches are then printed to the console.

The regular expressions used in the code are complex and may be difficult to understand for someone who is not familiar with regular expressions. However, the code provides a good example of how regular expressions can be used to find specific patterns in a string.
