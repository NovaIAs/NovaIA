Explanation:

1. `Public Sub ComplexVBCode()`: This is the main subroutine that contains all the code.

2. `Dim` statements: These statements declare variables of various types, including integers, strings, and arrays.

3. `For` loop: This loop iterates through the elements of the `arrNumbers` array and prints each element to the debug window.

4. `While` loop: This loop continues to iterate as long as the condition `i < 10` is true. It prints the value of `i` and then increments `i` by 1.

5. `Do While` loop: This loop executes the code block inside it at least once, even if the condition `j < 10` is initially false.

6. `If Else` statement: This statement checks if the value of `k` is even or odd and prints a message accordingly.

7. `Select Case` statement: This statement checks the value of `k` and executes different code blocks based on the value of `k`.

8. `Function Sum(...)`: This is a function that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum.

9. `Sub PrintMessage(...)`: This is a subroutine that takes a string as a parameter and prints it to the debug window.

10. Finally, the `Call` statements call the `Sum` function and the `PrintMessage` subroutine.
