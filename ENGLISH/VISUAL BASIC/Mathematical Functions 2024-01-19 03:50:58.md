* The `IsPrime` function determines if a given number is prime. It iterates through all numbers from 2 to n-1 and checks if n is evenly divisible by any of them. If it finds a divisor, it returns False, indicating that n is not prime. Otherwise, it returns True.
* The `Factor` function finds all factors of a given number. It iterates through all numbers from 2 to n-1 and checks if n is evenly divisible by any of them. If it finds a factor, it adds it to an array and continues searching for more factors. After checking all numbers, it returns the array of factors.
* The `IsPalindrome` function checks if a given number is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backward. It converts the number to a string, then iterates through half of the string and compares corresponding characters. If any two characters don't match, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
* The `GreatestCommonDivisor` function finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. It uses Euclid's algorithm, which involves repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.
* The `LeastCommonMultiple` function finds the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. It first finds the GCD of the two numbers, then returns the product of the two numbers divided by the GCD. This formula is valid because the LCM is always equal to the product of the two numbers divided by their GCD.
