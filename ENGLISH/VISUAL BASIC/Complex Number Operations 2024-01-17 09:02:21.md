This code implements a complex number type and a set of functions to perform various operations on complex numbers. The code includes functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, finding the absolute value, finding the conjugate, finding the phase angle, and finding the exponential and polar forms of a complex number. The code also includes a subroutine to test the complex number functions.

To use the code, you can create two complex numbers and then use the functions to perform various operations on them. For example, the following code adds two complex numbers and prints the result:

```visual basic
Dim a As ComplexNumber
Dim b As ComplexNumber
Dim result As ComplexNumber

a.Real = 3
a.Imaginary = 4
b.Real = 5
b.Imaginary = -2

result = AddComplexNumbers(a, b)
Debug.Print "The sum of the two complex numbers is: " & ExponentialFormComplexNumber(result)
```

The output of this code would be:

```
The sum of the two complex numbers is: 8 + 2i
```

You can also use the code to perform other operations on complex numbers, such as subtraction, multiplication, division, finding the absolute value, finding the conjugate, finding the phase angle, and finding the exponential and polar forms of a complex number.
