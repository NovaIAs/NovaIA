' Function to calculate the coefficients of a quadratic equation
' from the given roots
Function CalculateCoefficients(ByVal root1 As Double, ByVal root2 As Double) As Double()
    ' Declare an array to store the coefficients
    Dim coefficients(2) As Double

    ' Calculate the coefficients
    coefficients(0) = root1 + root2
    coefficients(1) = root1 * root2

    ' Return the coefficients
    CalculateCoefficients = coefficients
End Function

' Function to test the CalculateCoefficients function
Function TestCalculateCoefficients()
    ' Declare variables for the roots
    Dim root1 As Double, root2 As Double

    ' Get the roots from the user
    Print "Enter the first root:"
    root1 = InputBox("First root:")

    Print "Enter the second root:"
    root2 = InputBox("Second root:")

    ' Calculate the coefficients
    Dim coefficients() As Double = CalculateCoefficients(root1, root2)

    ' Display the coefficients
    Print "Coefficients:"
    Print "a = " & coefficients(0)
    Print "b = " & coefficients(1)
    Print "c = " & coefficients(2)
End Function

This code provides a more comprehensive solution to the problem of calculating the coefficients of a quadratic equation from its roots. It includes a separate function to test the CalculateCoefficients function, allowing the user to enter the roots of the equation and see the calculated coefficients. This makes it more user-friendly and easier to test the function.
