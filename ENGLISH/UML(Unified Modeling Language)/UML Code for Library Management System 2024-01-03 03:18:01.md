Sure! Here's a complex UML code for a system that manages a library:

```plantuml
@startuml

!define TABLE(x) class x as "Table" << (T,#FFAAAA) >>
!define ENTITY(x) class x as "Entity" << (E,#AAF0D1) >>
!define CONTROLLER(x) class x as "Controller" << (C,#FFE135) >>
!define SERVICE(x) class x as "Service" << (S,#B6E3F9) >>
!define REPOSITORY(x) class x as "Repository" << (R,#C2B280) >>

' Entities
ENTITY(Book)
ENTITY(Member)

' Controller
CONTROLLER(LibraryController)

' Service
SERVICE(LibraryService)

' Repositories
REPOSITORY(BookRepository)
REPOSITORY(MemberRepository)

' Associations
LibraryController --> LibraryService
LibraryService --> BookRepository
LibraryService --> MemberRepository

LibraryController "1" --> "1..*" Book
LibraryController "1" --> "0..*" Member

LibraryService "1" --> "1..*" Book
LibraryService "1" --> "0..*" Member

Book "1..*" --> "0..*" Member

Explanation:

In this UML code, we are modeling a library management system. The code consists of several UML elements such as classes, associations, and stereotypes.

- Entities: The entities represent the main entities in the system, which are "Book" and "Member". These entities are represented by rectangular boxes with the stereotype `(E)`.

- Controller: The "LibraryController" is responsible for handling requests and managing the flow of data between the user interface and the service layer. It is represented by a rectangular box with the stereotype `(C)`.

- Service: The "LibraryService" acts as a bridge between the controller and the repository, containing the business logic for the library operations. It is represented by a rectangular box with the stereotype `(S)`.

- Repositories: The "BookRepository" and "MemberRepository" are responsible for data access and persistence. They handle the storage and retrieval of books and member information, respectively. They are represented by rectangular boxes with the stereotype `(R)`.

- Associations: The associations represent the relationships between the different elements in the system. In this code, the "LibraryController" has associations with both the "LibraryService" and the entities "Book" and "Member". Similarly, the "LibraryService" has associations with the repositories and the entities. The associations are represented by arrows connecting the elements.

Overall, this UML code provides a visual representation of the library management system, showcasing the relationships between the entities, controllers, services, and repositories.
