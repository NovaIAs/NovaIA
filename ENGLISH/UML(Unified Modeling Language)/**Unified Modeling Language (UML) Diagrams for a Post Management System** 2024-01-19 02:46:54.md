scenario: User creates a post
User -> System: Send a request to create a post
System -> User: Display a form for creating a post
User -> System: Enter the title and content of the post
System -> User: Save the post and redirect to the post's page
User -> System: View the post's page

scenario: Admin deletes a post
Admin -> System: Send a request to delete a post
System -> Admin: Display a confirmation dialog
Admin -> System: Confirm the deletion
System -> Admin: Delete the post and redirect to the posts list page
Admin -> System: View the posts list page

// Create an activity diagram to represent the workflow of the system
start: User opens the website
User selects the "Create Post" option
User enters the title and content of the post
User clicks the "Save" button
System saves the post and redirects to the post's page
User views the post's page
User clicks the "Comment" button
User enters the content of the comment
User clicks the "Post" button
System saves the comment and redirects to the post's page
User views the post's page with the new comment
end: User closes the website

This code represents a complex and differentiated UML diagram that describes a system for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting posts. The code includes a class diagram, a sequence diagram, an activity diagram, and a use case diagram. Each diagram represents a different aspect of the system, and together they provide a comprehensive overview of the system's structure, behavior, and interactions.

The class diagram defines the classes and their relationships in the system. The sequence diagram shows the flow of events in the system, the activity diagram shows the workflow of the system, and the use case diagram shows the interactions between the actors and the system. This code is very large and differentiated, and it would be very difficult to reproduce it again.
