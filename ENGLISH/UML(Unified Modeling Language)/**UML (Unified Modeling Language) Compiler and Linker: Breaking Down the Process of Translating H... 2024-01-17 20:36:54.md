**Explanation:**

* **Tokenizer:** The tokenizer breaks the input string into individual tokens, such as keywords, operators, and identifiers.

* **Preprocessor:** The preprocessor processes the tokens and performs various tasks, such as macro expansion and conditional compilation.

* **Code Generator:** The code generator takes the processed tokens and generates machine code or assembly code.

* **Parser:** The parser takes the tokens and creates a parse tree, which represents the structure of the program.

* **Symbol Table:** The symbol table stores information about the identifiers in the program, such as their types and scopes.

* **Type Checker:** The type checker checks the types of the expressions in the program and ensures that they are consistent.

* **Optimizer:** The optimizer improves the efficiency of the code by removing unnecessary instructions and optimizing the order of operations.

* **Linker:** The linker combines the object files generated by the compiler into a single executable file.

* **Loader:** The loader loads the executable file into memory and starts it running.
