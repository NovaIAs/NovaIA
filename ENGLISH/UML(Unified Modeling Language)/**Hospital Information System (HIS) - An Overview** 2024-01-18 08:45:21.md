**Explanation:**

* The top level of the diagram shows the main components of a hospital information system: Patient Information, Treatment, Medical History and Examinations, Appointment Scheduling, Lab Results, Prescription, and Patient Billing.
* The Patient Information component contains information about the patient, such as their name, address, date of birth, and medical history.
* The Treatment component contains information about the patient's current treatment plan, including medications, procedures, and appointments.
* The Medical History and Examinations component contains information about the patient's past medical history and examinations, including test results, diagnoses, and treatments.
* The Appointment Scheduling component allows patients to schedule appointments with their doctor or other healthcare provider.
* The Lab Results component contains information about the patient's lab results, such as blood tests, X-rays, and MRIs.
* The Prescription component allows doctors to prescribe medications for their patients.
* The Patient Billing component allows patients to pay their bills for医疗服务.

The arrows between the components show the relationships between them. For example, the arrow from the Patient Information component to the Treatment component shows that the Treatment component uses information from the Patient Information component to create a treatment plan for the patient.

This is just a simple example of a hospital information system. In reality, these systems can be much more complex, with many more components and relationships. However, the basic principles are the same.
