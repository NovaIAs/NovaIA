Certainly! Here's a complex UML code example that models a library management system:

```
@startuml

package LibraryManagementSystem {
  
  class Library {
    - name: String
    - location: String
    - books: List<Book>
    - members: List<Member>
    + getName(): String
    + setName(name: String): void
    + getLocation(): String
    + setLocation(location: String): void
    + addBook(book: Book): void
    + removeBook(book: Book): void
    + getBooks(): List<Book>
    + addMember(member: Member): void
    + removeMember(member: Member): void
    + getMembers(): List<Member>
  }
  
  class Book {
    - title: String
    - author: String
    - publicationYear: String
    - available: boolean
    + getTitle(): String
    + setTitle(title: String): void
    + getAuthor(): String
    + setAuthor(author: String): void
    + getPublicationYear(): String
    + setPublicationYear(publicationYear: String): void
    + isAvailable(): boolean
    + setAvailable(available: boolean): void
  }
  
  class Member {
    - name: String
    - address: String
    - borrowedBooks: List<Book>
    + getName(): String
    + setName(name: String): void
    + getAddress(): String
    + setAddress(address: String): void
    + borrowBook(book: Book): void
    + returnBook(book: Book): void
    + getBorrowedBooks(): List<Book>
  }
  
  Library "1" *-- "*" Book
  Library "1" *-- "*" Member
  
}

This UML code models a library management system containing three main classes: `Library`, `Book`, and `Member`. The `Library` class represents a library and contains attributes such as `name`, `location`, `books`, and `members`. It also has methods for managing books and members, such as adding/removing books, getting the list of books, and adding/removing members.

The `Book` class represents a book in the library and contains attributes like `title`, `author`, `publicationYear`, and `available`. It also has methods for retrieving and modifying book details and availability.

The `Member` class represents a library member and contains attributes like `name`, `address`, and `borrowedBooks`. It has methods for managing borrowed books, such as borrowing and returning books, as well as retrieving the list of borrowed books.

The relationships between classes are represented using associations. The `Library` class has a one-to-many association with both `Book` and `Member` classes, indicating that a library can have multiple books and members. The association is represented by the multiplicity * (many).

This complex UML code provides a high-level overview of the library management system's structure, classes, and their relationships, allowing for better understanding and communication during the software development process.
