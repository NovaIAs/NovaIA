Sure! Here's a complex UML code representing a simplified e-commerce system:

```plantuml
@startuml

class User {
  - id: int
  - name: string
  - email: string
  - password: string
  + login(): boolean
  + logout(): void
  + updateProfile(): void
}

class Product {
  - id: int
  - name: string
  - price: double
  + displayDetails(): void
}

class Cart {
  - id: int
  - items: List<Product>
  - totalAmount: double
  + addItem(product: Product): void
  + removeItem(product: Product): void
  + calculateTotalAmount(): double
  + checkout(): boolean
}

class Order {
  - id: int
  - user: User
  - items: List<Product>
  - totalAmount: double
  - status: string
  + placeOrder(): boolean
  + cancelOrder(): boolean
  + updateStatus(newStatus: string): void
}

class Payment {
  - id: int
  - order: Order
  - paymentMethod: string
  - amount: double
  + processPayment(): boolean
  + refundPayment(): boolean
}

User "1" -- "0..*" Order
User "1" -- "0..1" Cart
Order "1" -- "0..*" Product
Order "1" -- "0..1" Payment

This UML diagram represents an e-commerce system that consists of four main classes: User, Product, Cart, Order, and Payment.

- The `User` class represents a user of the system, with attributes such as `id`, `name`, `email`, and `password`. It has methods for `login`, `logout`, and `updateProfile`.

- The `Product` class represents a product available for purchase, with attributes like `id`, `name`, and `price`. It has a method `displayDetails` to show the product information.

- The `Cart` class represents the shopping cart of a user, with attributes like `id`, `items` (a list of products), and `totalAmount` (the sum of prices of all items in the cart). It has methods to `addItem`, `removeItem`, `calculateTotalAmount`, and `checkout`.

- The `Order` class represents an order placed by a user, with attributes like `id`, `user`, `items` (a list of products in the order), `totalAmount`, and `status` (current status of the order). It has methods to `placeOrder`, `cancelOrder`, and `updateStatus`.

- The `Payment` class represents a payment made for an order, with attributes like `id`, `order`, `paymentMethod`, and `amount`. It has methods to `processPayment` and `refundPayment`.

The relationships between classes are represented using the UML notation. For example, a `User` can have multiple `Order` instances, denoted by the "1" to "0..*" association. Similarly, an `Order` can have multiple `Product` instances and a `Cart` can have a single `User` and zero or one `Order`.

This UML code provides a high-level overview of the e-commerce system's class structure and their associations, helping in understanding the relationships between the classes and their responsibilities.
