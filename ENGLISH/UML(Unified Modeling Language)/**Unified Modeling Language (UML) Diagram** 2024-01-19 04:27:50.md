**Explanation:**

* **User Interface:** This is the part of the system that the user interacts with. It can be a graphical user interface (GUI), a command-line interface (CLI), or any other type of user interface.
* **Business Logic:** This is the part of the system that implements the business rules. It is responsible for processing user input, performing calculations, and making decisions.
* **Data Access:** This is the part of the system that interacts with the data store. It is responsible for reading and writing data to the database.

The code is complex because it shows the relationships between the different parts of the system. It also shows how the data flows through the system. This type of diagram can be used to help understand the architecture of a system and to identify potential problems.

Here are some additional details about the code:

* The **User Interface** is shown as a box with the text "User Interface" inside.
* The **Business Logic** is shown as a box with the text "Business Logic" inside.
* The **Data Access** is shown as a box with the text "Data Access" inside.
* The arrows between the boxes show the flow of data between the different parts of the system.
* The lines connecting the boxes show the relationships between the different parts of the system.

This code is just a simplified example. In a real-world system, there would be many more parts and the relationships between them would be much more complex.
