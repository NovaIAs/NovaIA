This UML diagram represents a warehouse management system. It includes classes for products, customers, orders, and invoices. The relationships between these classes are shown using lines and arrows.

**Classes**

* **Product**: This class represents a product that is stored in the warehouse. It has attributes for the product code, name, price, quantity, and a list of orders associated with the product.
* **Customer**: This class represents a customer who has placed an order with the warehouse. It has attributes for the customer code, name, address, city, state, zip code, and a list of orders associated with the customer.
* **Order**: This class represents an order that has been placed by a customer. It has attributes for the order ID, date, customer ID, shipping address, and a list of products associated with the order.
* **Invoice**: This class represents an invoice that has been generated for an order. It has attributes for the invoice ID, date, order ID, customer ID, shipping address, and a list of products associated with the invoice.

**Relationships**

* **Product-Order**: This relationship shows that a product can be associated with multiple orders.
* **Customer-Order**: This relationship shows that a customer can place multiple orders.
* **Order-Invoice**: This relationship shows that an order can be associated with multiple invoices.

**Explanation**

This UML diagram provides a high-level overview of the warehouse management system. It shows the different classes and relationships that make up the system. This diagram can be used to understand the system's overall architecture and to identify the different components that make up the system.
