**Explanation**:

This code defines a class called `Complex` to represent complex numbers and perform various operations on them. The `Complex` class has two private properties: `real` and `imaginary`, which are used to store the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively.

The `Complex` class has a constructor to initialize the complex number, as well as methods to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two complex numbers. It also has methods to calculate the magnitude and argument of a complex number, and a `__toString()` method to convert the complex number to a string.

The main function of the code creates two complex numbers, `z1` and `z2`, and then performs various operations on them. The results of these operations are printed to the console.

This code demonstrates the use of complex numbers in PHP and how to perform various operations on them.
