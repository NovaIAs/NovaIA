This code defines a class for representing nodes in a graph, a class for representing edges in a graph, and a class for representing a queue of nodes. It also defines a function for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

To use this code, you would first need to create a graph by adding nodes and edges to it. You can then use the shortest_path function to find the shortest path between two nodes in the graph.

For example, the following code would create a graph and then find the shortest path between nodes A and E:

```php
$graph = new Graph();

$graph->add_node('A');
$graph->add_node('B');
$graph->add_node('C');
$graph->add_node('D');
$graph->add_node('E');

$graph->add_edge('A', 'B', 1);
$graph->add_edge('B', 'C', 2);
$graph->add_edge('C', 'D', 3);
$graph->add_edge('D', 'E', 4);
$graph->add_edge('E', 'A', 5);

$shortest_path = $graph->shortest_path('A', 'E');

echo "The shortest path between nodes A and E is: " . $shortest_path;
```

This code would output the following:

```
The shortest path between nodes A and E is: 6
```
