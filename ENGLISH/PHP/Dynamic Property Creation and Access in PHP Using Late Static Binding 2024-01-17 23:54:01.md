Explanation:

1. The `Shape` class has a `__set()` method that allows us to create new properties dynamically. This method takes a property name as a string and a value as a parameter.
2. The `__callStatic()` method is called when the class is accessed statically. It is used to create new instances of the `Shape` class.
3. The `__get()` method is used to get the value of a dynamic property. It takes a property name as a string as a parameter.
4. We create a `Shape` object using the `create()` method.
5. We set dynamic properties on the `Shape` object using the `__set()` method.
6. We access dynamic properties on the `Shape` object using the `__get()` method.
7. We create another `Shape` object using the `circle()` method.
8. We set dynamic properties on the `Circle` object using the `__set()` method.
9. We access dynamic properties on the `Circle` object using the `__get()` method.

This code demonstrates how to dynamically create and access properties in PHP using late static binding.
