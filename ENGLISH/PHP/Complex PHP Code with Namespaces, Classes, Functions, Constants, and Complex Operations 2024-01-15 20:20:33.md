Explanation:

1. Namespace: The code is placed inside a namespace called `MyComplexCode`. This is used to organize code and avoid naming conflicts with other code in the same project.
2. Class: A class named `VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedClass` is defined. Classes are used to group related data and behavior together.
3. Private Property: Inside the class, a private property named `veryLongAndComplexPropertyName` is defined. Private properties are only accessible within the class itself.
4. Public Method: A public method named `veryLongAndComplexMethodName` is defined within the class. Public methods can be accessed from outside the class.
5. Function: A function named `veryLongAndComplexFunction` is defined outside the class. Functions are used to perform specific tasks and can be reused in different parts of the code.
6. Constant: A constant named `VERY_LONG_AND_COMPLEX_CONSTANT` is defined using the `define()` function. Constants are used to store fixed values that cannot be changed during the execution of the program.
7. Usage: An object of the `VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedClass` class is created, and the `veryLongAndComplexMethodName` method is called on it. The result of the method call is stored in a variable named `result1`.
8. Complex Operation: The `result1` variable is printed to the output using the `echo` statement.

This code is complex because it includes multiple levels of nesting, uses complex names for variables, functions, classes, and constants, and performs complex operations. It is also not very readable and maintainable. It is generally not recommended to write code in this manner, as it can be difficult to understand and debug.
