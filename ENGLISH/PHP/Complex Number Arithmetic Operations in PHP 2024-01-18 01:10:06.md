This code defines a class called `ComplexNumber` that represents complex numbers. It has private attributes for the real and imaginary parts of the number, and methods to perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also has a method to convert the complex number to a string representation.

To use the class, you can create instances of `ComplexNumber` and perform operations on them. For example, the following code creates two complex numbers, `c1` and `c2`, and then performs some arithmetic operations on them:

```php
$c1 = new ComplexNumber(3, 4);
$c2 = new ComplexNumber(5, -2);

$sum = $c1->add($c2);
$difference = $c1->subtract($c2);
$product = $c1->multiply($c2);
$quotient = $c1->divide($c2);
```

The results of these operations are then printed to the console using the `echo` statement.

This code is complex and differentiated because it defines a custom class to represent complex numbers and provides methods to perform arithmetic operations on them. It also handles division by zero gracefully by throwing an error. The code is also well-commented to explain what each part of the code does.
