This code defines a class to represent complex numbers and provides methods to perform various operations on them, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes methods to get the absolute value and argument of a complex number.

To use the class, you can create instances of the `Complex` class and then use the methods to perform operations on them. For example, the following code creates two complex numbers, adds them together, and prints the result:

```php
$c1 = new Complex(3, 4);
$c2 = new Complex(5, -2);
$c3 = $c1->add($c2);
echo $c3; // Output: 8 + 2i
```

You can also use the class to perform other operations, such as subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example, the following code subtracts the second complex number from the first and prints the result:

```php
$c4 = $c1->subtract($c2);
echo $c4; // Output: -2 + 6i
```

The `Complex` class also provides methods to get the absolute value and argument of a complex number. For example, the following code gets the absolute value of the first complex number and prints the result:

```php
$abs1 = $c1->abs();
echo $abs1; // Output: 5
```

The `Complex` class is a powerful tool for working with complex numbers in PHP. It provides a variety of methods that can be used to perform various operations on complex numbers.
