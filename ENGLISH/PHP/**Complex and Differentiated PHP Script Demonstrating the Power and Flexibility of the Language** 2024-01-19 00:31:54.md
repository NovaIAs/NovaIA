**Explanation of the code:**

* The first section of the code defines a class called `ComplexCode`, which contains a number of methods for performing various tasks.
* The second section of the code defines a function called `main()`, which calls the methods of the `ComplexCode` class to perform the desired tasks.
* The `generateRandomNumber()` method generates a random number between 1 and 100.
* The `calculateFactorial()` method calculates the factorial of a number.
* The `isPrime()` method checks if a number is prime.
* The `findGreatestCommonDivisor()` method finds the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
* The `findLeastCommonMultiple()` method finds the least common multiple of two numbers.
* The `generateRandomString()` method generates a random
