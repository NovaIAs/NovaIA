Explanation:

This PHP script demonstrates a complex and differentiated code that is unlikely to be repeated. It includes:

1. A multidimensional array of data representing people with their names, ages, and occupations.
2. A function to filter the data based on a condition (in this case, filtering people who are older than 30).
3. A class to represent a person with properties for name, age, and occupation.
4. Sorting an array of Person objects by age using the usort function.
5. A function to calculate the average age of an array of Person objects.
6. Calculating and printing the average age of the people.

This code showcases a variety of PHP features and techniques, including data structures, functions, classes, sorting, and calculations.
