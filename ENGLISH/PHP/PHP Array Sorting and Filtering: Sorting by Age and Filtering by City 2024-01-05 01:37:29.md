```

This code performs a complex data manipulation task in PHP. It takes an array of person objects, sorts them by age, and then filters them by city. The code uses a combination of built-in PHP functions and custom functions to achieve this result.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Define the input array:**

```php
$input = array(
    array('name' => 'John Doe', 'age' => 25, 'city' => 'New York'),
    array('name' => 'Jane Smith', 'age' => 30, 'city' => 'London'),
    array('name' => 'Michael Jones', 'age' => 35, 'city' => 'Paris'),
    array('name' => 'Mary Johnson', 'age' => 40, 'city' => 'Rome'),
    array('name' => 'Robert Brown', 'age' => 45, 'city' => 'Berlin'),
);
```

This array contains five person objects, each with three properties: `name`, `age`, and `city`.

2. **Function to sort the array by age:**

```php
function sortByAge($a, $b) {
    return $a['age'] - $b['age'];
}
```

This function is used to sort the array of person objects by age. It takes two person objects as input and returns the difference between their ages. The `usort()` function will use this function to sort the array in ascending order of age.

3. **Function to filter the array by city:**

```php
function filterByCity($city) {
    return function($person) use ($city) {
        return $person['city'] === $city;
    };
}
```

This function is used to filter the array of person objects by city. It takes a city name as input and returns a function that can be used to filter the array. The returned function takes a person object as input and returns `true` if the person's city matches the specified city, and `false` otherwise.

4. **Sort the array by age:**

```php
usort($input, 'sortByAge');
```

This line of code uses the `usort()` function to sort the `$input` array using the `sortByAge()` function as the sorting callback. This will sort the array of person objects in ascending order of age.

5. **Filter the array by city:**

```php
$filtered = array_filter($input, filterByCity('London'));
```

This line of code uses the `array_filter()` function to filter the `$input` array using the `filterByCity('London')` function as the filtering callback. This will filter the array to include only the person objects whose city is 'London'.

6. **Print the results:**

```php
echo '<pre>';
print_r($filtered);
echo '</pre>';
```

This line of code uses the `echo` statement to print the results of the filtering operation to the console. The `print_r()` function is used to print the array in a human-readable format.

This code is a good example of how to use PHP functions and closures to perform complex data manipulation tasks. It is also a good example of how to use sorting and filtering to extract specific data from a larger dataset.
