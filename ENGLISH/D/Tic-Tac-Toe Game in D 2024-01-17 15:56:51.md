This code implements a game of tic-tac-toe in the D programming language.

The `View` class represents the game board and provides methods for printing the board, checking for a winner, and making moves.

The `Player` enum represents the two players in the game.

The `Game` class manages the game loop and interacts with the View class to play the game.

The `main` function creates a new Game instance and calls the `play` method to start the game.

The code is designed to be clear and concise, with each component handling a specific aspect of the game. The use of enums for representing players and square states, along with the use of lambdas for concise syntax, makes the code easy to read and understand.

The code also demonstrates the use of various D language features, such as traits, template metaprogramming, and the `apply` method for applying functions to arrays.
