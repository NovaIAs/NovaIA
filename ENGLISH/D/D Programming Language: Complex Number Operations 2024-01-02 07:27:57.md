Certainly! Here's a complex code in the D programming language:

```d
import std.stdio;

class ComplexNumber {
    private double real;
    private double imaginary;

    this(double real, double imaginary) {
        this.real = real;
        this.imaginary = imaginary;
    }

    ComplexNumber add(ComplexNumber other) {
        return new ComplexNumber(real + other.real, imaginary + other.imaginary);
    }

    ComplexNumber subtract(ComplexNumber other) {
        return new ComplexNumber(real - other.real, imaginary - other.imaginary);
    }

    ComplexNumber multiply(ComplexNumber other) {
        double newReal = real * other.real - imaginary * other.imaginary;
        double newImaginary = real * other.imaginary + imaginary * other.real;
        return new ComplexNumber(newReal, newImaginary);
    }

    ComplexNumber divide(ComplexNumber other) {
        double divisor = other.real * other.real + other.imaginary * other.imaginary;
        double newReal = (real * other.real + imaginary * other.imaginary) / divisor;
        double newImaginary = (imaginary * other.real - real * other.imaginary) / divisor;
        return new ComplexNumber(newReal, newImaginary);
    }

    string toString() {
        if (imaginary >= 0) {
            return real.to!string ~ " + " ~ imaginary.to!string ~ "i";
        } else {
            return real.to!string ~ " - " ~ abs(imaginary).to!string ~ "i";
        }
    }
}

void main() {
    ComplexNumber complex1 = new ComplexNumber(3, 2);
    ComplexNumber complex2 = new ComplexNumber(1, -4);

    ComplexNumber sum = complex1.add(complex2);
    ComplexNumber difference = complex1.subtract(complex2);
    ComplexNumber product = complex1.multiply(complex2);
    ComplexNumber quotient = complex1.divide(complex2);

    writeln("Complex 1: ", complex1.toString());
    writeln("Complex 2: ", complex2.toString());
    writeln("Sum: ", sum.toString());
    writeln("Difference: ", difference.toString());
    writeln("Product: ", product.toString());
    writeln("Quotient: ", quotient.toString());
}
```

This code demonstrates the implementation of a complex number class in D. The `ComplexNumber` class represents a complex number with real and imaginary components. It provides methods for basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers.

The `main` function creates two complex numbers `complex1` and `complex2` with initial values. It then performs different operations on these complex numbers using the methods provided by the `ComplexNumber` class. The results are printed to the console using the `writeln` function.

The `ComplexNumber` class encapsulates the real and imaginary components of a complex number and provides methods to perform arithmetic operations. The `toString` method is overridden to provide a formatted string representation of the complex number.

This code showcases object-oriented programming principles in D and demonstrates the usage of classes and methods to work with complex numbers.
