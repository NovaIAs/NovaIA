Explanation:

* The code uses a template function `Size` to find the largest or smallest value in a collection.
* The template function takes two arguments:
    * `T`: The type of the elements in the collection.
    * `comp`: A comparison function that compares two elements of type `T`.
* The function works by iterating over all pairs of elements in the collection and keeping track of the largest or smallest element seen so far.
* The `nothrow` and `@safe` attributes indicate that the function does not throw exceptions and that it is safe to call from other threads.
* The `main` function uses the `Size` function to find the largest and smallest values in a collection of characters, a collection of doubles, and a collection of strings.
* The output of the program is:
    * `d`
    * `3.14`
    * `"dog"`

This code is complex and differentiated because it uses a generic template function to solve a problem that can be applied to different types of data. It also uses a lambda expression to define the comparison function, which makes the code more concise and readable.
