```d
import std.stdio, std.algorithm;

void main() {
    // Define a struct to represent a person.
    struct Person {
        string name;
        int age;
        double height;
    }

    // Create an array of people.
    Person[] people = {
        Person("Alice", 20, 1.65),
        Person("Bob", 25, 1.80),
        Person("Carol", 30, 1.70),
        Person("Dave", 35, 1.90),
        Person("Eve", 40, 1.75)
    };

    // Sort the array of people by their age.
    people.sort!((a, b) => a.age < b.age);

    // Print the names of the people in the array.
    foreach (person; people)
        writeln(person.name);

    // Calculate the average height of the people in the array.
    double averageHeight = 0;
    foreach (person; people)
        averageHeight += person.height;
    averageHeight /= people.length;

    // Print the average height.
    writeln("Average height:", averageHeight);

    // Find the person with the maximum height.
    Person tallestPerson = people[0];
    foreach (person; people)
        if (person.height > tallestPerson.height)
            tallestPerson = person;

    // Print the name of the person with the maximum height.
    writeln("Tallest person:", tallestPerson.name);

    // Find the person with the minimum height.
    Person shortestPerson = people[0];
    foreach (person; people)
        if (person.height < shortestPerson.height)
            shortestPerson = person;

    // Print the name of the person with the minimum height.
    writeln("Shortest person:", shortestPerson.name);
}
```

This code is a bit longer than the previous example, but it demonstrates more of the features of the D language.

The first part of the code defines a struct to represent a person. The struct has three fields: name, age, and height.

The next part of the code creates an array of people. The array is initialized with five Person objects, each representing a different person.

The next part of the code sorts the array of people by their age. The sort method is called on the array, and the lambda expression passed to the sort method specifies how the people should be compared. In this case, the people are compared by their age.

The next part of the code prints the names of the people in the array. The foreach statement is used to iterate over the array, and the name field of each person is printed.

The next part of the code calculates the average height of the people in the array. The averageHeight variable is initialized to 0, and then the height field of each person is added to the averageHeight variable. The averageHeight variable is then divided by the length of the array to get the average height.

The next part of the code finds the person with the maximum height. The tallestPerson variable is initialized to the first person in the array. Then, the foreach statement is used to iterate over the array, and the height field of each person is compared to the height field of the tallestPerson variable. If the height of the current person is greater than the height of the tallestPerson variable, then the tallestPerson variable is updated to the current person.

The next part of the code prints the name of the person with the maximum height.

The next part of the code finds the person with the minimum height. The shortestPerson variable is initialized to the first person in the array. Then, the foreach statement is used to iterate over the array, and the height field of each person is compared to the height field of the shortestPerson variable. If the height of the current person is less than the height of the shortestPerson variable, then the shortestPerson variable is updated to the current person.

The next part of the code prints the name of the person with the minimum height.
