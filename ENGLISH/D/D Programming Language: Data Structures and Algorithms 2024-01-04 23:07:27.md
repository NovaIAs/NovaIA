    immutable list nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

    // Use the remove() function to remove the element at the specified index
    nums.remove(index);

    // Use the sort() function to sort the list in ascending order
    nums.sort();

    // Use the reverse() function to reverse the order of the elements in the list
    nums.reverse();

    // Use the join() function to concatenate the elements of the list into a string, separated by commas
    string str = nums.join(",");

    // Print the resulting string

    // Use the size() function to get the number of people in the map

This code demonstrates the use of various data structures and algorithms in the D programming language. It includes:

* **Lists:** A list is a collection of elements that can be accessed by their index. In this example, a list of integers is created and various operations are performed on it, such as iterating over the elements, finding the index of a specific element, removing an element, sorting the list, and reversing the order of the elements.
* **Maps:** A map is a collection of key-value pairs. In this example, a map is used to store the names and ages of people. Various operations are performed on the map, such as adding and removing people, finding the age of a specific person, and getting the size of the map.
* **Sets:** A set is a collection of unique elements. In this example, a set is used to store the names of fruits. Various operations are performed on the set, such as adding and removing fruits, finding if the set contains a specific fruit, and getting the size of the set.
* **Algorithms:** This code also demonstrates the use of some common algorithms, such as sorting and searching. The sort() function is used to sort the list of integers in ascending order, and the find() function is used to find the index of a specific element in the list and the map.

Overall, this code provides a comprehensive demonstration of the use of data structures and algorithms in D.
