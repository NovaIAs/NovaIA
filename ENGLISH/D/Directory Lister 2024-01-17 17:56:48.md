```d
// This is a program that prints the contents of a directory.
// It uses the `std.path` library to work with paths, and the `std.stdio` library to print output.
import std.path, std.stdio;

// This function takes a path as an argument and prints the contents of the directory at that path.
void printDirectoryContents(string path) pure nothrow @nogc {
    // Get a list of all the files and directories in the directory.
    foreach (file in directoryContents(path)) {
        // Print the name of the file or directory.
        writefln("%s", file.name);
    }
}

void main() {
    // Get the current working directory.
    string cwd = cwd();

    // Print the contents of the current working directory.
    printDirectoryContents(cwd);
}
```

This program first imports the `std.path` and `std.stdio` libraries. Then, it defines a function called `printDirectoryContents` that takes a path as an argument and prints the contents of the directory at that path. The function uses the `directoryContents` function from the `std.path` library to get a list of all the files and directories in the directory, and then it uses the `writefln` function from the `std.stdio` library to print the name of each file or directory.

Finally, the program calls the `main` function, which gets the current working directory and then calls the `printDirectoryContents` function to print the contents of the current working directory.
