```d
import std.algorithm, std.stdio, std.range, std.foreach, std.traits;

void main() {
    // Define a function to compare two strings case-insensitively
    auto compareStrings = [](string a, string b) pure nothrow {
        return a.toLower() < b.toLower();
    };

    // Create a vector of strings
    auto strings = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "durian", "elderberry"];

    // Sort the vector using the case-insensitive comparison function
    strings.sort(compareStrings);

    // Print the sorted vector
    foreach (string s; strings) {
        writeln(s);
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1. We start by importing the necessary modules, including `std.algorithm` for sorting, `std.stdio` for input and output, `std.range` and `std.foreach` for iterating over collections, and `std.traits` for function traits.

2. We define a function called `compareStrings` that takes two strings as arguments and returns a boolean value indicating whether the first string is less than the second string, considering case-insensitive comparisons.

3. We create a vector of strings called `strings` containing various fruits.

4. We use the `sort` function on the `strings` vector, passing the `compareStrings` function as the comparison function. This sorts the vector of strings in ascending order based on the case-insensitive comparison.

5. Finally, we use a `foreach` loop to iterate over the sorted `strings` vector and print each string to the console.

This code demonstrates a more complex and differentiated use of the D programming language, involving custom comparison functions, sorting, and iterating over collections. It also showcases the use of lambda expressions (anonymous functions) and pure and nothrow function attributes.
