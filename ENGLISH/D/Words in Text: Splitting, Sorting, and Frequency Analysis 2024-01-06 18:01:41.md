    string text = "Hello, world!";

    // Create a vector of strings to store the words in the text.

    // Split the text into words using the split() function.
    words = text.split(' ');

    // Print the words in the vector.
    foreach (word; words) {
        writeln(word);
    }

    // Sort the vector of strings.

    }

    // Find the first occurrence of the word "world" in the vector.
    int index = words.index("world");

    // If the word "world" was found, print its index.

    // Count the frequency of each word in the text.
    foreach (word; words) {
        if (wordFrequencies.containsKey(word)) {
            wordFrequencies[word]++;
        } else {
            wordFrequencies[word] = 1;
        }

This code is a more complex and differentiated example of a D program. It demonstrates the use of vectors, maps, and iterators. It also shows how to split a string into words, sort a vector of strings, and find the frequency of words in a text.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The `import` statement imports the necessary modules.
* The `main` function is the entry point of the program.
* The `string` variable `text` is initialized with the text "Hello, world!".
* The `vector!string` variable `words` is created to store the words in the text.
* The `split()` function is used to split the text into words. The `split()` function takes a character as an argument and splits the string into words based on that character. In this case, the `split()` function is called with the space character as an argument, which means that it will split the text into words based on the spaces.
* The `foreach` statement is used to iterate over the `words` vector and print the words.
* The `sort()` function is used to sort the `words` vector. The `sort()` function sorts the elements of the vector in ascending order.
* The `index()` function is used to find the first occurrence of the word "world" in the `words` vector. The `index()` function takes a string as an argument and returns the index of the first occurrence of that string in the vector.
* The `if` statement is used to check if the word "world" was found in the vector. If the word "world" was found, the `writeln()` function is used to print its index. Otherwise, the `writeln()` function is used to print a message indicating that the word "world" was not found.
* The `map!string, int` variable `wordFrequencies` is created to store the word frequencies.
* The `foreach` statement is used to iterate over the `words` vector and count the frequency of each word. If a word is already in the `wordFrequencies` map, its frequency is incremented. Otherwise, the word is added to the `wordFrequencies` map and its frequency is set to 1.
* The `foreach` statement is used to iterate over the `wordFrequencies` map and print the word frequencies.

This code demonstrates the power of the D programming language and its ability to handle complex tasks.
