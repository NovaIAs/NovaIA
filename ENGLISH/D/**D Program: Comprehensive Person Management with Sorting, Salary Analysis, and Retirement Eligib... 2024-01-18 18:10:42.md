**Explanation:**

This D code defines a complex structure representing `Person` with various attributes, including `name`, `age`, `isEmployed`, `salary`, and `socialSecurityNumber`. It also provides several methods for working with `Person` objects, such as `calculateRetirementAge()`, `isEligibleForRetirementBenefits()`, and `printInfo()`.

The code defines a couple of functions for comparing `Person` objects based on age and name. It also defines helper functions to find the person with the highest salary and find all people eligible for retirement benefits.

In the `main` function, it creates an array of `Person` objects, sorts them by age and name, finds the person with the highest salary, and finds all people eligible for retirement benefits. Finally, it prints the results.

This code demonstrates the use of various features of the D programming language, including structures, methods, functions, arrays, sorting, and filtering.
