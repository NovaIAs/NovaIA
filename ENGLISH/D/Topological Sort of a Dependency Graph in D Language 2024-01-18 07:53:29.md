This code is a complex and differentiated program written in D language. It implements a topological sort algorithm on a dependency graph. The program first defines a `Task` struct, which represents a task with an ID, name, priority, and dependencies. It then defines a `Tasks` immutable collection, which is a list of tasks. The `DependencyGraph` struct represents a dependency graph, which is a collection of tasks with dependencies between them. The `TopologicalSort` immutable collection represents a topological sort, which is a linear ordering of the tasks in the dependency graph such that all dependencies are satisfied.

The program then defines a function `topologicalSort` that takes a dependency graph as input and returns a topological sort. The function uses a depth-first search algorithm to find a topological sort. The `printTopologicalSort` function is used to print the results of a topological sort.

Finally, the program creates a dependency graph, adds tasks to the graph, and then prints the graph. It then calls the `topologicalSort` function to perform a topological sort on the graph and prints the results of the sort.

This program is a good example of how to use D language to solve a complex problem. It demonstrates the use of structs, immutable collections, and functions to create a program that is both powerful and easy to understand.
