This code defines a multidimensional array, then prints its length and the lengths of its subarrays. Finally, it prints the value of the first element of the array.

The code uses the `typedef` keyword to define a type alias for a multidimensional array. The type alias `T` is defined as a tuple of tuples of integers. The code then uses the `immutable` keyword to make the array immutable, which means that its elements cannot be modified after they have been assigned.

The code then creates an instance of the `T` type, called `t`. The `t` variable is initialized with a list of lists of integers. The first list contains three lists of integers, and the second list contains three lists of integers.

The code then uses the `writeln()` function to print the value of the `t` variable. The `writeln()` function prints the value of its argument to the console, and then adds a newline character.

The code then uses the `length` property to print the length of the `t` variable. The `length` property returns the number of elements in the array.

The code then uses the `length` property to print the length of the first subarray of the `t` variable. The `length` property is called on the first element of the `t` variable, which is a list of integers.

The code then uses the `length` property to print the length of the first subarray of the first subarray of the `t` variable. The `length` property is called on the first element of the first subarray of the `t` variable, which is a list of integers.

Finally, the code uses the `[]` operator to access the first element of the first subarray of the first subarray of the `t` variable. The `[]` operator is used to access the elements of an array. The code then uses the `writeln()` function to print the value of the element.
