This code defines a trait for types that can be serialized to a string, and then uses that trait to define classes for a person and a list of people. The `serialize()` method in the `Person` class appends the person's name and age to the given string buffer, while the `serialize()` method in the `People` class appends the names and ages of all the people in the list to the given string buffer.

The `deserializePeople()` function takes a string and parses it into a list of people. The function first splits the string into a list of objects, then converts each object into a person, and finally returns a list of the people.

The `main()` function creates a list of people, serializes the list to a string, prints the serialized string, deserializes the list from the string, and then prints the deserialized list.

This code demonstrates how to define traits and classes in D, and how to use them to serialize and deserialize objects.
