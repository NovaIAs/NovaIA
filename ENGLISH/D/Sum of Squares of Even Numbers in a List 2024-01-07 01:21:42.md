Explanation:

1. `import std.stdio, std.string, std.algorithm, std.range;`: This line imports several standard modules that are used in the code.

2. `immutable int[] numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];`: This line declares a list of integers named `numbers` and assigns it the values `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. The `immutable` keyword indicates that the list cannot be modified once it is created.

3. `auto evenNumbers = numbers.filter!((n) => n % 2 == 0);`: This line uses the `filter!` method on the `numbers` list to create a new list called `evenNumbers`. The lambda function `(n) => n % 2 == 0` is used to filter out all the odd numbers from the list, leaving only the even numbers.

4. `auto squaredEvenNumbers = evenNumbers.map!((n) => n * n);`: This line uses the `map!` method on the `evenNumbers` list to create a new list called `squaredEvenNumbers`. The lambda function `(n) => n * n` is used to map each even number to its square.

5. `immutable int sumOfSquaredEvenNumbers = squaredEvenNumbers.reduce!((a, b) => a + b);`: This line uses the `reduce!` method on the `squaredEvenNumbers` list to reduce the list to a single value, which is the sum of all the squared even numbers. The lambda function `(a, b) => a + b` is used to add each element of the list to the previous one.

6. `writeln("The sum of the squares of the even numbers in the list is: ", sumOfSquaredEvenNumbers);`: This line uses the `writeln` function to print the result of the calculation to the console.
