This code demonstrates various features of the D programming language, including:

1. **Struct Definition**: It defines a struct named `Person` to represent a person with two fields: `name` and `age`.

2. **Function Definition**: It defines two functions: `comparePersonsByAge` and `printPerson`. `comparePersonsByAge` compares two persons by their age and returns a boolean indicating the order. `printPerson` prints the name and age of a person.

3. **Array/List Declaration**: It creates an array of `Person` objects named `persons` using the array literal syntax.

4. **Sorting**: It sorts the `persons` array by age using the standard library's `sort!` function, passing in the `comparePersonsByAge` function as the comparison function.

5. **Iteration**: It iterates over the sorted list of persons using a `foreach` loop and prints each person's name and age using the `printPerson` function.

6. **Channel Communication**: It creates a channel named `ages` to communicate between threads using the `Channel!` macro. Channels are used to send and receive data between concurrent threads.

7. **Thread Creation**: It creates two threads using the `thread!` macro. The first thread calculates the average age of the persons and writes the result to the `ages` channel. The second thread reads the average age from the channel and prints it.

8. **Thread Joining**: It joins the threads using the `join()` method to wait for them to finish before proceeding.

This code demonstrates D's features for data structures, sorting, iteration, concurrency, and thread communication. It also showcases the use of the standard library and macros for concise and efficient code.
