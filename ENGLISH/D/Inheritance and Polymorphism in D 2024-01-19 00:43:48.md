Explanation:

1. `Superclass` and `Subclass`: These are two classes that demonstrate inheritance and polymorphism.

   - `Superclass`: It has an integer member `i` and defines a constructor that initializes `i` and a `print()` method to print the value of `i`.

   - `Subclass`: It inherits from `Superclass` and adds another integer member `j`. It also overrides the `print()` method to print both `i` and `j`.

2. Constructors:

   - `Superclass`: It has two constructors: a default constructor and a constructor that takes an integer argument and initializes `i` with that value.

   - `Subclass`: It has a default constructor (which calls the default constructor of `Superclass`) and a constructor that takes two integer arguments and initializes `i` and `j` with those values.

3. `main()` Function:

   - It creates instances of `Superclass` and `Subclass` in different blocks to demonstrate the lifetimes of objects.

   - It calls the `print()` method on each object to demonstrate polymorphism.

4. Destructors:

   - Both `Superclass` and `Subclass` have destructors that are called when the objects are destroyed.
   - Destructors are used to clean up resources and print messages to indicate when an object is destroyed.

This code demonstrates inheritance, polymorphism, constructors, destructors, and memory management in D.
