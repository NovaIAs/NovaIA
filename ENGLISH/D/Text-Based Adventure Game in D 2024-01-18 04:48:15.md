This code implements a simple text-based adventure game in D. The player can explore a world, pick up and drop items, examine objects, and move around. The game is saved and loaded automatically.

The code is structured as follows:

* The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It reads the player's input, parses it into a command and arguments, and then calls the appropriate function to handle the command.
* The `Player` struct represents the player character. It contains an inventory of items, the current room the player is in, and a list of commands the player can use.
* The `Room` struct represents a room in the game world. It contains a list of items in the room, a list of exits from the room, and a description of the room.
* The `Item` struct represents an item in the game world. It contains a name, a description, and a weight.
* The `Exit` struct represents an exit from a room. It contains a name, a destination room, and a description.

The game data is loaded from a text file when the program starts. The player can then explore the world by typing commands. Commands are entered by typing a command followed by any arguments required by the command. For example, to take an item, the player would type `take itemName`.

The game saves the player's progress automatically when the player quits the game. The game can be loaded again later by starting the program again and typing `load`.
