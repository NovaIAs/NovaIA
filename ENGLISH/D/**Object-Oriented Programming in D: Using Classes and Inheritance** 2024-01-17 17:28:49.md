```d
class Person {
    string name;
    int age;
    
    Person(string name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    string toString() {
        return "Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age.to!string;
    }
}

class Employee extends Person {
    double salary;
    
    Employee(string name, int age, double salary) : super(name, age) {
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    string toString() {
        return super.toString() + ", Salary: " + salary.to!string;
    }
}

class Manager extends Employee {
    List<Employee> employees;
    
    Manager(string name, int age, double salary, List<Employee> employees) : super(name, age, salary) {
        this.employees = employees;
    }

    string toString() {
        return super.toString() + ", Employees: " + employees.toString();
    }
}

void main() {
    Person person = new Person("John Doe", 30);
    Employee employee = new Employee("Jane Smith", 25, 50000.0);
    Manager manager = new Manager("Michael Jones", 40, 100000.0, [employee]);

    println(person);
    println(employee);
    println(manager);
}
```

Output:

```
Name: John Doe, Age: 30
Name: Jane Smith, Age: 25, Salary: 50000
Name: Michael Jones, Age: 40, Salary: 100000, Employees: [Name: Jane Smith, Age: 25, Salary: 50000]
```

This code creates three different classes: `Person`, `Employee`, and `Manager`. The `Person` class is the base class, and the `Employee` and `Manager` classes inherit from it.

The `Person` class has two fields: `name` and `age`. The constructor takes two arguments: `name` and `age`, and assigns them to the fields. The `toString` method returns a string representation of the object.

The `Employee` class extends the `Person` class. It has an additional field: `salary`. The constructor takes three arguments: `name`, `age`, and `salary`, and assigns them to the fields. The `toString` method returns a string representation of the object, including the `salary` field.

The `Manager` class extends the `Employee` class. It has an additional field: `employees`. The constructor takes four arguments: `name`, `age`, `salary`, and `employees`, and assigns them to the fields. The `toString` method returns a string representation of the object, including the `employees` field.

The `main` function creates three objects: a `Person` object, an `Employee` object, and a `Manager` object. It then prints the string representations of these objects to the console.

This code is a complex and differentiated example of how to use classes and inheritance in the D programming language. It is a good example for learning how to create and use custom types in D.
