Certainly! Here's a complex and differentiated code in the D programming language:

```d
import std.stdio;

void main()
{
    // Define a struct to represent a complex number
    struct Complex
    {
        double real;
        double imaginary;
    }

    // Define a function to calculate the square root of a complex number
    Complex sqrt(Complex num)
    {
        Complex result;

        if (num.imaginary == 0)
        {
            result.real = sqrt(num.real);
            result.imaginary = 0;
        }
        else
        {
            double magnitude = sqrt(num.real * num.real + num.imaginary * num.imaginary);
            double angle = atan2(num.imaginary, num.real);

            result.real = sqrt(magnitude) * cos(angle / 2);
            result.imaginary = sqrt(magnitude) * sin(angle / 2);
        }

        return result;
    }

    // Define a function to calculate the factorial of a complex number
    Complex factorial(Complex num)
    {
        Complex result;

        if (num.imaginary == 0 && num.real >= 0 && num.real == int(num.real))
        {
            result.real = 1;

            for (int i = 1; i <= num.real; i++)
            {
                result.real *= i;
            }

            result.imaginary = 0;
        }
        else
        {
            result.real = result.imaginary = NaN;
        }

        return result;
    }

    // Test the sqrt and factorial functions
    Complex number1 = Complex(4, 0);
    Complex sqrtResult = sqrt(number1);
    Complex number2 = Complex(5, 3);
    Complex factorialResult = factorial(number2);

    writefln("The square root of %.2f + %.2fi is %.2f + %.2fi", number1.real, number1.imaginary, sqrtResult.real, sqrtResult.imaginary);
    writefln("The factorial of %.2f + %.2fi is %.2f + %.2fi", number2.real, number2.imaginary, factorialResult.real, factorialResult.imaginary);
}
```

Explanation:

This code demonstrates the usage of complex numbers in the D programming language. It defines a struct `Complex` to represent a complex number with real and imaginary parts. It also includes two functions, `sqrt` and `factorial`, to calculate the square root and factorial of a complex number, respectively.

The `sqrt` function checks if the imaginary part is zero. If so, it calculates the square root of the real part directly. Otherwise, it calculates the magnitude and angle of the complex number using the `sqrt` and `atan2` functions, and then applies the square root operation using the magnitude and half of the angle.

The `factorial` function checks if the complex number has no imaginary part, a non-negative real part, and an integer real part. If these conditions are met, it calculates the factorial of the real part using a loop. Otherwise, it returns a complex number with NaN (not a number) as both the real and imaginary parts.

Finally, the code tests the `sqrt` and `factorial` functions by calculating the square root of a complex number (4 + 0i) and the factorial of another complex number (5 + 3i). The results are then printed using the `writefln` function.

Note: The complexity of the code lies in the implementation of the complex number operations (square root and factorial) and the handling of various scenarios involving complex numbers.
