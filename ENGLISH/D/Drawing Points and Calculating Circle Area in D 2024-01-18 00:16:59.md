Explanation:

* The code starts by importing a number of standard libraries, including the standard algorithm library, the standard array library, the standard stdio library, the standard range library, and the standard bigint library.
* The `Color` enumeration defines a set of colors, each represented by an integer value. The `Color` enumeration also defines some special colors, such as `Purple`, `Cyan`, `Yellow`, and `White`, which are created by combining the values of the primary colors.
* The `Point` structure defines a point in two-dimensional space, with an x-coordinate, a y-coordinate, and a color.
* The `drawPoint` function draws a point on the screen, using the specified color.
* The `makePointArray` function creates an array of `Point` structures, each with a random x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and color.
* The `PI` constant is defined as the value of pi, approximately 3.14159265.
* The `areaOfCircle` function calculates the area of a circle, given its radius.
* The `main` function calls the `makePointArray` function to create an array of 100 random points, and then calls the `drawPoint` function to draw each point on the screen. The `main` function also calls the `areaOfCircle` function to calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 5.0.
