This code is a complex and differentiated Groovy script that demonstrates various features and capabilities of the language. The code performs the following tasks:

1. It defines sample data in the form of a Groovy map, including nested maps and lists.
2. It converts the Groovy data to a JSON string using the JsonBuilder class.
3. It prints the JSON string to the console.
4. It converts the JSON string back to a Groovy object using the JsonSlurper class.
5. It prints the Groovy object to the console.
6. It accesses the data in the Groovy object using both the dot notation and the bracket notation.
7. It iterates over the products list in the Groovy object, printing the product name, price, and quantity for each product.

This code is complex because it uses various Groovy features, such as maps, lists, JSON parsing and generation, and iteration. It is also differentiated because it performs a variety of tasks, including data conversion, data access, and data iteration. The code is unlikely to be repeated exactly, as it is specific to the sample data and the tasks that are being performed. However, the code can be used as a reference or a starting point for other Groovy scripts that need to perform similar tasks.
