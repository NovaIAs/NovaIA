```groovy
// Define a class to represent a complex object

    // Declare properties of the class
    String name

    // Define a constructor to initialize the properties
    ComplexObject(String name, int age, List<String> hobbies) {

// Iterate over the list of complex objects and print their properties

// Use Groovy's powerful metaprogramming capabilities to dynamically add a new property to the ComplexObject class
ComplexObject.metaClass.favoriteColor = { -> "blue" }

// Access the dynamically added property on one of the complex objects
println complexObjects[0].favoriteColor

// Use Groovy's closures to define a custom sorting order for the list of complex objects

Explanation:

The code defines a class called ComplexObject with three properties: name, age, and hobbies. It also includes a constructor to initialize these properties and a method to print the object's information.

The code then creates a list of ComplexObject instances and adds them to the list.

It then iterates over the list of complex objects and prints their properties.

After that, it dynamically adds a new property called favoriteColor to the ComplexObject class using Groovy's metaprogramming capabilities.

The code accesses the dynamically added property on one of the complex objects.

It then uses Groovy's closures to define a custom sorting order for the list of complex objects based on their age.

Finally, it prints the sorted list of complex objects.

This code demonstrates various features of Groovy, including classes, lists, closures, metaprogramming, and sorting. It also shows how to dynamically add new properties to classes at runtime.
