```groovy
// This is a multiline Groovy comment.

// Define a class called "Person" with some properties.
class Person {
    String name
    int age
    String city
}

// Create a list of Person objects.
def people = [
    new Person(name: "John Doe", age: 30, city: "New York"),
    new Person(name: "Jane Smith", age: 25, city: "London"),
    new Person(name: "Michael Jones", age: 40, city: "Paris")
]

// Use the each() method to iterate over the list of people.
people.each { person ->
    // Print the person's name and age.
    println "Name: ${person.name}, Age: ${person.age}"
}

// Use the find() method to find the first person who is older than 35.
def olderPerson = people.find { person ->
    person.age > 35
}

// Print the older person's name.
println "Older Person: ${olderPerson.name}"

// Use the findAll() method to find all people who live in New York.
def peopleInNewYork = people.findAll { person ->
    person.city == "New York"
}

// Print the names of the people who live in New York.
println "People in New York:"
peopleInNewYork.each { person ->
    println person.name
}

// Use the sort() method to sort the list of people by age.
people.sort { person1, person2 ->
    person1.age <=> person2.age
}

// Print the names of the people sorted by age.
println "People sorted by age:"
people.each { person ->
    println person.name

// Use the collect() method to create a list of the names of the people.
def names = people.collect { person ->
    person.name
}

// Print the list of names.
println "Names:"
names.each { name ->
    println name
}

// Use the groupBy() method to group the people by city.
def peopleByCity = people.groupBy { person ->
    person.city
}

// Print the groups of people by city.
println "People grouped by city:"
peopleByCity.each { city, people ->

**Explanation:**

This Groovy code demonstrates various features of the language, including:

- **Classes and Objects:** The `Person` class is defined with properties for name, age, and city. Objects of this class are created and stored in a list.


- **Iteration:** The `each()` method is used to iterate over the list of people and print their names and ages.


- **Conditional Checks:** The `find()` and `findAll()` methods are used to find specific people based on conditions.


- **Sorting:** The `sort()` method is used to sort the list of people by age.


- **Collection Operations:** The `collect()` method is used to create a list of the names of the people.


- **Grouping:** The `groupBy()` method is used to group the people by city.

This code is a comprehensive example of how to use Groovy to manipulate and process data in a variety of ways.
