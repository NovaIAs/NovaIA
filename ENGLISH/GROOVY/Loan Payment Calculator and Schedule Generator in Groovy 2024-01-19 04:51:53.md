```groovy
// This Groovy script calculates the monthly payments for a loan using the formula:
// monthlyPayment = (principal * annualInterestRate / 12) / (1 - (1 + annualInterestRate / 12)^(-numberOfPayments))

// Define the input parameters
BigDecimal principal = new BigDecimal("100000") // The amount of the loan
BigDecimal annualInterestRate = new BigDecimal("0.05") // The annual interest rate, as a decimal
int numberOfPayments = 120 // The number of months over which the loan will be repaid

// Calculate the monthly payment
BigDecimal monthlyPayment = (principal * annualInterestRate / 12) / (1 - (1 + annualInterestRate / 12)^(-numberOfPayments))

// Print the monthly payment
println("The monthly payment for the loan is: \$${monthlyPayment}")

// Create a table showing the loan payment schedule
println("\nLoan Payment Schedule:")
println("| Month | Payment Amount | Remaining Balance |")
println("|---|---|---|")

// Initialize the remaining balance to the principal amount
BigDecimal remainingBalance = principal

// Loop through the months and calculate the payment amount and remaining balance for each month
for (int i = 1; i <= numberOfPayments; i++) {
    // Calculate the payment amount for the current month
    BigDecimal paymentAmount = monthlyPayment

    // Calculate the remaining balance after the current month's payment
    remainingBalance -= paymentAmount

    // Print the payment amount and remaining balance for the current month
    println("| ${i} | \$${paymentAmount} | \$${remainingBalance} |")
}
```

This Groovy script calculates the monthly payments for a loan using the formula provided and also creates a table showing the loan payment schedule. The script takes the input parameters (principal, annual interest rate, and number of payments) and calculates the monthly payment using the formula. It then creates a table showing the month, payment amount, and remaining balance for each month of the loan.

The script uses the built-in BigDecimal class to handle the monetary calculations with precision. It also uses the loop and printing capabilities of Groovy to create the table.

The output of the script will be something like this:

```
The monthly payment for the loan is: $877.83

Loan Payment Schedule:
| Month | Payment Amount | Remaining Balance |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | $877.83 | $99122.17 |
| 2 | $877.83 | $98244.34 |
| 3 | $877.83 | $97366.51 |
| ... | ... | ... |
| 119 | $877.83 | $1198.34 |
| 120 | $877.83 | $0.00 |
```

This script demonstrates the use of Groovy's mathematical and printing capabilities, as well as its ability to handle loops and create tables.
