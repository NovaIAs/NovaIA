This code is a complex and differentiated Groovy script that performs the following tasks:

1. It imports the necessary libraries, including the Groovy JSON library, the Groovy HTTP library, and the Java networking library.
2. It defines a static class called HttpRequest that encapsulates the logic for sending HTTP requests.
3. The HttpRequest class has a method called get that takes a URL as input and sends a GET request to that URL. It then returns the response as a string.
4. The main method of the script gets the URL of the JSON data from the command line arguments.
5. The main method then calls the get method of the HttpRequest class to send a GET request to the URL and get the response as a string.
6. The main method then parses the JSON string into a map using the Groovy JSON library.
7. Finally, the main method iterates over the map and prints the key-value pairs.

This code is complex and differentiated because it uses a number of different Groovy features, including static classes, method chaining, and the Groovy JSON library. It also performs a number of different tasks, including sending an HTTP request, parsing JSON data, and printing key-value pairs.
