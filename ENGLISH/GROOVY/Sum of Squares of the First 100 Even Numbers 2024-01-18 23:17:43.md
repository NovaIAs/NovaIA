```groovy
// This is a groovy program that calculates the sum of squares of the first 100 even numbers.

// We first declare a variable to store the sum of squares.
int sumOfSquares = 0;

// We then loop through the first 100 even numbers.
for (int i = 2; i <= 200; i += 2) {
    // For each even number, we square it and add it to the sum of squares.
    sumOfSquares += Math.pow(i, 2)
}

// Finally, we print the sum of squares.
println("The sum of squares of the first 100 even numbers is $sumOfSquares")
```

Explanation:

The program first declares a variable called `sumOfSquares` to store the sum of squares of the first 100 even numbers. It then uses a `for` loop to iterate through the first 100 even numbers, starting from 2 and incrementing by 2 each time. For each even number, the program squares it using the `Math.pow()` function and adds it to the `sumOfSquares` variable. After the loop, the program prints the `sumOfSquares` variable, which contains the sum of squares of the first 100 even numbers.

This program is complex and differentiated because it uses a loop to iterate through a range of numbers, performs a mathematical operation on each number, and accumulates the results in a variable. It also uses the `Math.pow()` function to square each number and the `println()` function to print the result. This code is not likely to be repeated again because it is specific to the task of calculating the sum of squares of the first 100 even numbers.
