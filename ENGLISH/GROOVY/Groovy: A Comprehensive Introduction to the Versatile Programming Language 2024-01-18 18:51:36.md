Explanation:

1. Multiline Comments: Groovy allows you to use `/*` and `*/` for multiline comments.

2. Printing to the Console: `println` is used to print a message to the console.

3. Variables: `def` is used to declare a variable.

4. Lists: Square brackets `[]` are used to create a list.

5. Maps: Maps are enclosed in square brackets with key-value pairs separated by a colon `:`.

6. Closures: Closures are enclosed in braces `{}`. They can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments to methods.

7. Classes: Classes can be defined using the `class` keyword or using a closure.

8. Instances of Classes: Instances of classes can be created using the `new` keyword.

9. Methods: Methods are defined using the `def` keyword followed by the method name, parentheses for parameters, and braces for the body of the method.
