```groovy
// This is a Groovy program to demonstrate a complex and differentiated code.

// Define a class called ComplexCode.
class ComplexCode {

    // Define a method called main.
    static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a list of numbers.
        def numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

        // Iterate over the list of numbers and print each number.
        numbers.each { number ->
            println number
        }

        // Create a map of names and ages.
        def people = [
                "John": 25,
                "Mary": 30,
                "Bob": 35
        ]

        // Iterate over the map of people and print each name and age.
        people.each { name, age ->
            println "$name is $age years old."
        }

        // Create a closure that takes a number as an argument and returns the square of the number.
        def square = { number ->
            number * number
        }

        // Use the closure to calculate the square of each number in the list of numbers.
        def squaredNumbers = numbers.collect(square)

        // Print the squared numbers.
        squaredNumbers.each { number ->
            println number
        }

        // Create a function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the sum of the numbers.
        def sum = { numbers ->
            numbers.sum()
        }

        // Use the function to calculate the sum of the numbers in the list of numbers.
        def total = sum(numbers)

        // Print the total.
        println "The total is $total."
    }
}
```

This code is a complex and differentiated code that demonstrates a variety of Groovy features. The code includes:

* A class called ComplexCode.
* A method called main.
* A list of numbers.
* A map of names and ages.
* A closure that takes a number as an argument and returns the square of the number.
* A function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the sum of the numbers.

The code demonstrates how to:

* Iterate over a list of numbers and print each number.
* Iterate over a map of names and ages and print each name and age.
* Use a closure to calculate the square of each number in a list of numbers.
* Use a function to calculate the sum of a list of numbers.

This code is a good example of how Groovy can be used to write complex and differentiated code.
