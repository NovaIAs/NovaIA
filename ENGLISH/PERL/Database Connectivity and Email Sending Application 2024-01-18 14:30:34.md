This code connects to a MySQL database, sends an email, and then disconnects from the database. The code is complex and differentiated because it uses multiple modules, including DBI, MIME::Lite, and Socket. The code is also organized into multiple subroutines, which makes it easier to read and understand.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

* The `connect_to_database()` subroutine connects to a MySQL database using the DBI module. The subroutine takes the following parameters:

    * `$host`: The hostname of the database server.
    * `$port`: The port number of the database server.
    * `$user`: The username to use to connect to the database.
    * `$password`: The password to use to connect to the database.
    * `$database`: The name of the database to connect to.

* The `send_email()` subroutine sends an email using the MIME::Lite module. The subroutine takes the following parameters:

    * `$to`: The email address of the recipient.
    * `$from`: The email address of the sender.
    * `$subject`: The subject of the email.
    * `$body`: The body of the email.

* The `main()` subroutine calls the `connect_to_database()` and `send_email()` subroutines, and then disconnects from the database.
