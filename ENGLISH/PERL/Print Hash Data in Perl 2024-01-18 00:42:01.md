```perl
use strict;
use warnings;

# Define a hash to store the data
my %data = (
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'age' => 30,
    'address' => '123 Main Street',
    'city' => 'Anytown',
    'state' => 'CA',
    'zip' => '12345',
    'phone' => '555-1212',
    'email' => 'johndoe@example.com',
);

# Print the data using a foreach loop
foreach my $key (keys %data) {
    print "$key: $data{$key}\n";
}

# Print the data using a while loop
my $key = keys %data;
while ($key) {
    print "$key: $data{$key}\n";
    $key = keys %data;
}

# Print the data using a for loop
for my $key (keys %data) {
    print "$key: $data{$key}\n";
}

# Print the data using a map function
print map { "$_: $data{$_}\n" } keys %data;

# Print the data using a join function
print join("\n", map { "$_: $data{$_}" } keys %data);
```

This code defines a hash called %data to store the data. The keys of the hash are the names of the data items, and the values of the hash are the actual data items.

The code then prints the data using a variety of methods, including foreach loops, while loops, for loops, map functions, and join functions.

This code is complex and differentiated because it uses a variety of methods to print the data. It also uses a hash to store the data, which is a more advanced data structure than an array.

This code is also unlikely to be repeated again because it is very specific to the task of printing the data from a hash.
