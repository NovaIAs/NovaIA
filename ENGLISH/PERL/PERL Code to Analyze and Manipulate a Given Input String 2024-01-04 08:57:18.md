Here is a complex and differentiated code in Perl that is unlikely to be repeated again:

```
use strict;
use warnings;

my $input_string = 'This is a sample input string.';

# Create a hash to store the frequencies of each character in the input string.
my %char_freq;
foreach my $char (split //, $input_string) {
    $char_freq{$char}++;
}

# Find the character with the highest frequency.
my $max_freq = 0;
my $max_char;
foreach my $char (keys %char_freq) {
    if ($char_freq{$char} > $max_freq) {
        $max_freq = $char_freq{$char};
        $max_char = $char;
    }
}

# Print the character with the highest frequency and its frequency.
print "$max_char occurs $max_freq times in the input string.\n";

# Create a histogram of the character frequencies.
my $histogram = '';
foreach my $char (sort keys %char_freq) {
    $histogram .= "$char: " . ('*' x $char_freq{$char}) . "\n";
}

# Print the histogram.
print "Histogram of character frequencies:\n";
print $histogram;

# Find the longest word in the input string.
my $longest_word;
my @words = split /\s+/, $input_string;
foreach my $word (@words) {
    if (length($word) > length($longest_word)) {
        $longest_word = $word;
    }
}

# Print the longest word.
print "Longest word in the input string: $longest_word\n";

# Find the shortest word in the input string.
my $shortest_word;
foreach my $word (@words) {
    if (length($word) < length($shortest_word) || !defined $shortest_word) {
        $shortest_word = $word;
    }
}

# Print the shortest word.
print "Shortest word in the input string: $shortest_word\n";

# Count the number of vowels in the input string.
my $vowel_count = 0;
foreach my $char (split //, $input_string) {
    if ($char =~ /[aeiouAEIOU]/) {
        $vowel_count++;
    }
}

# Print the number of vowels.
print "Number of vowels in the input string: $vowel_count\n";

# Count the number of consonants in the input string.
my $consonant_count = 0;
foreach my $char (split //, $input_string) {
    if ($char =~ /[bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ]/) {
        $consonant_count++;
    }
}

# Print the number of consonants.
print "Number of consonants in the input string: $consonant_count\n";
```

This code performs a variety of tasks on the input string:

* It counts the frequency of each character in the string and prints the character with the highest frequency.
* It creates a histogram of the character frequencies.
* It finds the longest and shortest words in the string.
* It counts the number of vowels and consonants in the string.

The code is complex and differentiated because it performs a variety of tasks on the input string, and it uses a variety of Perl features, such as hashes, regular expressions, and loops. The code is also unlikely to be repeated again because it is very specific to the input string that is provided.
