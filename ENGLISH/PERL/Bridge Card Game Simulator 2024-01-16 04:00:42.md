This code simulates a game of bridge, where four players are dealt 13 cards each from a standard deck of 52 cards. The objective of the game is to score points by winning tricks, which are sets of four cards played one by one by each player. The player who wins the trick gets to lead the next trick.

The code uses a custom data structure called `Card` to represent a single card in a deck. The `Card` package has three methods: `suit`, `rank`, and `str`. The `suit` method returns the suit of the card (e.g., "clubs"), the `rank` method returns the rank of the card (e.g., "Ace"), and the `str` method returns a string representation of the card (e.g., "Ace of clubs").

The main program starts by initializing the deck of cards, shuffling the deck, and dealing the cards to four players. The `shuffle` subroutine uses the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to shuffle the deck. The `find_winner` subroutine calculates the score for each player and returns the player with the highest score.

The `find_winner` subroutine uses a hash to store the scores for each player. It iterates over each player's hand and adds the value of each card to the player's score. The value of a card is 11 for an Ace, 10 for a Jack, Queen, or King, and the face value for other cards.

After calculating the scores for each player, the `find_winner` subroutine finds the player with the highest score. It returns the name of the player with the highest score as a string.

The main program prints the winner of the game to the console.
