This code is a Perl program that calculates the factorial of a number. It defines a subroutine called `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and returns the factorial of that number. The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers up to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

The main part of the program gets the input from the user and checks if it is a valid integer. If it is a valid integer, the program calls the `factorial` subroutine to calculate the factorial of the number and prints the result. Otherwise, the program prints an error message.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The `use strict` and `use warnings` statements are used to enable strict mode and warnings in Perl. This helps to catch errors and potential problems in the code.
2. The `factorial` subroutine is defined. It takes a number as an argument and returns the factorial of that number. The subroutine uses recursion to calculate the factorial. If the number is 0, it returns 1 (the factorial of 0 is defined to be 1). Otherwise, it multiplies the number by the factorial of the previous number.
3. The main part of the program begins by printing a prompt asking the user to enter a number.
4. The `chomp` function is used to remove the newline character from the input.
5. The `=~` operator is used to check if the input matches a regular expression. The regular expression `^\d+$` matches a string that consists of one or more digits.
6. If the input matches the regular expression, the program calls the `factorial` subroutine to calculate the factorial of the number.
7. The `print` function is used to print the result to the console.
8. If the input does not match the regular expression, the program prints an error message.
