# This Perl script is designed to be complex and highly differentiated, with multiple levels of nested loops, conditional statements, and data structures.
# Its primary purpose is to demonstrate the versatility and expressive power of the Perl programming language.

# Start by creating a 2D array to represent a grid of cells, where each cell can be either alive or dead.
my $grid = [[0] x 10] x 10;

# Populate the grid with a random distribution of alive and dead cells.
for my $row (0..9) {
    for my $col (0..9) {
        $grid->[$row][$col] = int(rand(2));
    }

sub count_neighbors {
    my ($grid, $row, $col) = @_;
    my $count = 0;

    # Iterate over the 8 neighboring cells.
    for my $i (-1..1) {
        for my $j (-1..1) {

            next if $i == 0 && $j == 0;

            # Check if the neighboring cell is within the grid bounds and alive.
            if ($row + $i >= 0 && $row + $i <= 9 && $col + $j >= 0 && $col + $j <= 9 && $grid->[$row + $i][$col + $j]) {
                $count++;
            }
        }
    }

    return $count;

Explanation:

1. **Grid Initialization:** We create a 2D array called `$grid` to represent a grid of cells. Each element in the grid can be either `0` (dead cell) or `1` (alive cell).

2. **Random Population:** We populate the grid with a random distribution of alive and dead cells using a nested loop.

3. **Neighbor Counting Function:** We define a function called `count_neighbors` that takes the grid, row, and column of a given cell. It then counts the number of alive neighboring cells within the grid bounds.

4. **Game of Life Rules:** We iterate through the grid multiple times, applying the rules of Conway's Game of Life to each cell to determine its state in the next generation:
    - A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives.
    - A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.
    - All other cells die.

5. **Generation Update:** After applying the rules to all cells, we create a new grid `$new_grid` to hold the next generation of cells and update the current grid `$grid` with it.

6. **Printing the Grid:** After each generation, we print the current state of the grid to the console, displaying alive cells as "#" and dead cells as " ".

This complex and differentiated Perl script showcases the language's flexibility and power in handling complex data structures and implementing intricate algorithms.
