**Explanation:**

1. The `clean_text` subroutine cleans the input text by removing punctuation and converting it to lowercase. It then splits the text into an array of words.
2. The `count_words` subroutine takes an array of words and counts the frequency of each word. It returns a hash where the keys are the words and the values are the frequencies.
3. The `find_most_frequent_words` subroutine takes a hash of word frequencies and returns an array of the most frequent words. It sorts the word frequencies in descending order and then selects the top N words.
4. The main program gets the input text from the user, cleans it, counts the frequency of each word, and then finds the most frequent words. It finally displays the most frequent words and their frequencies.

This code is complex and differentiated because it combines multiple subroutines to perform different tasks, such as cleaning the text, counting the word frequencies, and finding the most frequent words. It also uses advanced Perl features such as hashes and sorting.
