**Explanation:**

1. **Package Definition**: The `package` keyword is used to define a module's namespace. In this case, the module is named `MyComplexCode`.

2. **Module Imports**: The `use` keyword is used to import modules and their functions into the current scope. This code imports modules for data manipulation, file handling, and web requests.

3. **Complex Data Structure**: A complex data structure is created using a hash of arrays (%complex_data). This data structure is used to store and manipulate data in a more organized manner.

4. **Data Dumping**: The Data::Dumper module is used to print the complex data structure in a human-readable format, making it easier to inspect and understand its contents.

5. **File Reading**: The File::Slurp module is used to read the contents of a file and store them in a variable. This is a convenient way to work with file contents without having to deal with file handles directly.

6. **Filename and Extension Extraction**: The File::Basename module is used to extract the filename and extension from a given path. This is useful for tasks like identifying file types and generating unique filenames.

7. **File Writing**: The IO::File module is used to write data to a file. The code opens a file in write mode, writes some data to it, and then closes the file.

8. **HTTP Requests**: The LWP::Simple module is used to send HTTP requests and receive responses. The code makes a GET request to a specified URL and prints the response status code and content.

This code demonstrates the use of various Perl modules and techniques to perform complex tasks such as manipulating complex data structures, reading and writing files, and sending HTTP requests.
