# Print the names and ages of the oldest and youngest people
printf "\nOldest person: %s (%d years old)\n", $oldest_name, $oldest_age;
printf "Youngest person: %s (%d years old)\n", $youngest_name, $youngest_age;

# Calculate the average age of the people in the hash
my $total_age = 0;
foreach my $age (values %people) {

# Print the average age
printf "\nAverage age: %.2f years old\n", $average_age;
```

This code creates a hash to store the names and ages of people, then creates an array of the names in alphabetical order. It then prints the names and ages of the people in a formatted table.

The code then finds the oldest and youngest people in the hash, and prints their names and ages. It also calculates the average age of the people in the hash, and prints the average age.

This code is complex because it uses a variety of Perl features, including hashes, arrays, loops, and conditionals. It also uses the printf() function to format the output.
