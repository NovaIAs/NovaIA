# This Perl script is a complex and differentiated code that generates a variety of output based on user input.
# The code is divided into several sections, each of which performs a specific task.

# The first section of the code defines a subroutine named "generate_output" that takes a single parameter, "$input".
# This subroutine is responsible for generating the output based on the input provided.
sub generate_output {
    my $input = shift;

    # The subroutine starts by checking the value of "$input".
    if ($input eq "hello") {
        # If "$input" is equal to "hello", the subroutine prints "Hello, world!" to the console.
        print "Hello, world!\n";
    } elsif ($input eq "goodbye") {
        # If "$input" is equal to "goodbye", the subroutine prints "Goodbye, world!" to the console.
        print "Goodbye, world!\n";
    } elsif ($input eq "help") {
        # If "$input" is equal to "help", the subroutine prints a list of available commands to the console.
        print "Available commands:\n";
        print "\thello - prints 'Hello, world!'\n";
        print "\tgoodbye - prints 'Goodbye, world!'\n";
        print "\thelp - prints this help message\n";
    } else {
        # If "$input" is not equal to any of the recognized commands, the subroutine prints an error message to the console.
        print "Invalid command. Please enter 'hello', 'goodbye', or 'help'.\n";
    }
}

# The second section of the code defines a main program that prompts the user for input and then calls the "generate_output" subroutine to generate the output.
MAIN: {
    # The main program starts by printing a welcome message to the console.
    print "Welcome to the Perl script!\n";

    # The main program then enters a loop that prompts the user for input and calls the "generate_output" subroutine to generate the output.
    while (1) {
        # The main program prints a prompt to the console.
        print "Enter a command (hello, goodbye, help, or quit): ";

        # The main program reads the user's input from the console.
        my $input = <STDIN>;

        # The main program removes the newline character from the user's input.
        chomp $input;

        # The main program checks the value of "$input".
        if ($input eq "quit") {
            # If "$input" is equal to "quit", the main program exits the loop and terminates the script.
            last;
        }

        # The main program calls the "generate_output" subroutine to generate the output.
        generate_output($input);
    }

    # The main program prints a goodbye message to the console.
    print "Goodbye!\n";
}

**Explanation:**

* The first section of the code defines a subroutine named "generate_output" that takes a single parameter, "$input". This subroutine is responsible for generating the output based on the input provided.

* The subroutine starts by checking the value of "$input". If "$input" is equal to "hello", the subroutine prints "Hello, world!" to the console. If "$input" is equal to "goodbye", the subroutine prints "Goodbye, world!" to the console. If "$input" is equal to "help", the subroutine prints a list of available commands to the console. If "$input" is not equal to any of the recognized commands, the subroutine prints an error message to the console.

* The second section of the code defines a main program that prompts the user for input and then calls the "generate_output" subroutine to generate the output.

* The main program starts by printing a welcome message to the console. The main program then enters a loop that prompts the user for input and calls the "generate_output" subroutine to generate the output. The main program checks the value of "$input". If "$input" is equal to "quit", the main program exits the loop and terminates the script. The main program calls the "generate_output" subroutine to generate the output.

* The main program prints a goodbye message to the console.
