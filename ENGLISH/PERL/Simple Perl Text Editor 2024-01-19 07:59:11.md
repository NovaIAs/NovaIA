This program is a simple text editor that allows the user to create, open, save, and edit text files. The program uses the FileHandle and IO::Select modules to handle the input and output.

The program starts by creating a new FileHandle object for the input and output. It then creates a new IO::Select object to handle the input and output. The program then enters a loop to handle the user input.

In the loop, the program waits for input on the input and output. If there is input on the input, the program reads it and processes it. If there is input on the output, the program writes it.

The program processes the input by splitting it into parts. The first part is the command. The rest of the parts are the arguments. The program then calls the appropriate subroutine for the command.

The program has four commands: create, open, save, and quit. The create command creates a new file. The open command opens a file. The save command saves the current file. The quit command quits the program.

If the user enters an invalid command, the program prints an error message.

The program also has a subroutine to handle text input. This subroutine simply adds the line of text to the current file.

The program runs until the user enters the quit command.
