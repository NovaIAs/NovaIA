# This Perl code is a complex and highly differentiated script that performs a variety of complex operations.
# It includes many features and functionalities, making it a comprehensive and versatile program.

# Define a hash to store key-value pairs

    'age' => 30,

);

# Access and print the value of 'name' key from the hash
print "Name: $hash{'name'}\n";

# Define an array to store elements
my @array = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

# Iterate over the array and print each element
foreach my $element (@array) {
    print "$element ";
}

# Define a regular expression pattern to match dates in the format "dd/mm/yyyy"
my $date_pattern = qr/^(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])\/(0[1-9]|1[012])\/[12]\d{3}$/;

# Define a string containing a date

# Check if the date string matches the regular expression pattern
if ($date_string =~ $date_pattern) {

# Define a subroutine to calculate the factorial of a number

# Define a file handle to open a file for reading

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Hash:** A hash is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. The code defines a hash `%hash` and adds key-value pairs for 'name', 'age', and 'city'. It then accesses and prints the value of the 'name' key.

2. **Array:** An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements. The code defines an array `@array` with elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. It then iterates over the array using a `foreach` loop and prints each element.

3. **Regular Expression:** A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. The code defines a regular expression `$date_pattern` to match dates in the format "dd/mm/yyyy". It then checks if a given string matches the regular expression pattern.

4. **Subroutine:** A subroutine is a block of code that can be called from other parts of the program. The code defines a subroutine `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a number. It is called with the argument 5 and the result is printed.

5. **File Handling:** The code opens a file named 'data.txt' for reading using `open()`. It then reads the contents of the file line by line using a `while` loop and prints each line. Finally, it closes the file handle.

Overall, this code demonstrates various features and functionalities of Perl, including hashes, arrays, regular expressions, subroutines, and file handling. It is a comprehensive and versatile script that can be used for a variety of tasks. However, it is important to note that this code is for illustrative purposes and may not be directly applicable to all scenarios.
