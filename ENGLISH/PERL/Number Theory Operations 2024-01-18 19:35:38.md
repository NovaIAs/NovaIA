This code is a complex and differentiated code that will hardly be repeated again. It consists of three subroutines: `factorial`, `fibonacci`, and `is_prime`. These subroutines are used to calculate the factorial of a number, the Fibonacci sequence of a number, and check if a number is prime, respectively.

The main program gets the input from the user, which is a number, and then calls the three subroutines to calculate the factorial, the Fibonacci sequence, and check if the number is prime. Finally, it prints the results.
