This code defines a hash to store the employees and their information. It then defines a subroutine to print the employee information for a given employee ID. The subroutine checks if the employee exists, and if so, prints their name, title, salary, and benefits.

The code then uses the subroutine to print the employee information for employee ID 1. It then tries to print the employee information for employee ID 4, which doesn't exist, and prints a "Employee not found" message.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The `use strict;` and `use warnings;` statements enable strict mode and warnings, which help to catch errors and typos.
* The `use Data::Dumper;` statement imports the Data::Dumper module, which is used to print the employee information in a human-readable format.
* The `my %employees = (...)` line defines a hash to store the employees and their information. The hash is keyed by employee ID, and each value is a hash containing the employee's name, title, salary, and benefits.
* The `sub print_employee_info { ... }` line defines a subroutine named `print_employee_info`. The subroutine takes one argument, which is the employee ID.
* The `my $employee_id = shift;` line shifts the employee ID from the subroutine's argument list.
* The `if (exists $employees{$employee_id}) { ... }` line checks if the employee exists in the `%employees` hash. If the employee exists, the code inside the `if` block is executed.
* The `my $employee = $employees{$employee_id};` line gets the employee's information from the `%employees` hash.
* The `print "Employee ID: $employee_id\n";` line prints the employee's ID.
* The `print "Name: $employee->{name}\n";` line prints the employee's name.
* The `print "Title: $employee->{title}\n";` line prints the employee's title.
* The `print "Salary: $employee->{salary}\n";` line prints the employee's salary.
* The `print "Benefits:\n";` line prints a header for the employee's benefits.
* The `foreach my $benefit_type (keys %{$employee->{benefits}}) { ... }` line loops through the benefit types in the employee's benefits hash. For each benefit type, the code inside the `foreach` loop is executed.
* The `print "  $benefit_type: $employee->{benefits}->{$benefit_type}\n";` line prints the benefit type and the benefit value.
* The `} else { ... }` line is executed if the employee does not exist.
* The `print "Employee not found\n";` line prints a "Employee not found" message.
* The `print_employee_info(1);` line prints the employee information for employee ID 1.
* The `print_employee_info(4);` line prints the employee information for employee ID 4, which doesn't exist, and prints a "Employee not found" message.
