Explanation:

1.	Data Import: The script begins by reading the data from a CSV file named 'data.csv' and parsing it into an array of hashes, where each hash represents a row in the CSV file.

2.	Descriptive Statistics: Using the Statistics::Descriptive module, the script calculates descriptive statistics for each variable in the dataset, including mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.

3.	Correlation Analysis: The script then calculates the correlation between each pair of variables using the correlation() method from the Statistics::Descriptive module.

4.	Bar Chart Creation: The GD::Graph::bars module is employed to generate a bar chart visualizing the data. The chart displays the values of each variable for each data point.

5.	Summary of Analysis: Finally, the script prints a summary of the analysis, including the descriptive statistics and correlation coefficients.
