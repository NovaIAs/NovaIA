Certainly! Here's a complex and differentiated Perl code that demonstrates various features of the language:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

# Define a custom object class
package Person;

sub new {
    my ($class, $name, $age) = @_;
    my $self = {
        name => $name,
        age => $age,
    };
    bless $self, $class;
    return $self;
}

sub get_name {
    my ($self) = @_;
    return $self->{name};
}

sub get_age {
    my ($self) = @_;
    return $self->{age};
}

# Create a list of Person objects
my @people = (
    Person->new("John", 25),
    Person->new("Jane", 30),
    Person->new("Alice", 40),
    Person->new("Bob", 35),
);

# Sort the list based on age in descending order
@people = sort { $b->get_age() <=> $a->get_age() } @people;

# Print the sorted list
print "Sorted list:\n";
foreach my $person (@people) {
    printf("%s - Age: %d\n", $person->get_name(), $person->get_age());
}

# Calculate the average age
my $total_age = 0;
foreach my $person (@people) {
    $total_age += $person->get_age();
}
my $average_age = @people ? $total_age / @people : 0;

print "Average age: $average_age\n";
```

Explanation:
1. The code begins by declaring a Perl class `Person` which represents a person's name and age.
2. The `new` method is implemented to create a new `Person` object with the provided name and age.
3. The `get_name` and `get_age` methods are defined to retrieve the person's name and age, respectively.
4. An array `@people` is created, containing four `Person` objects with different names and ages.
5. The `@people` array is sorted based on the person's age in descending order using the `sort` function and a custom comparison function.
6. The sorted list is then printed to the console, displaying each person's name and age.
7. The code proceeds to calculate the average age of the people in the sorted list by summing up the ages and dividing by the number of people.
8. Finally, the average age is printed to the console.

This Perl code showcases object-oriented programming, array manipulation, sorting, and basic arithmetic operations.
