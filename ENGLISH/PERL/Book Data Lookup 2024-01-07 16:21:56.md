This Perl code defines a hash to store book data, including the title, author, genre, and number of pages. It then creates a subroutine to print the book data based on the book title. The user is prompted to enter a book title, and the subroutine is called to print the corresponding book data. If the book title is not found in the hash, an error message is printed.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Hash to Store Book Data (%books):**
   - The `%books` hash is defined using the `hash` data structure in Perl.
   - Each key in the hash is the title of a book.
   - The value associated with each key is a hash reference that contains information about the book, including the author, genre, and number of pages.

2. **Subroutine to Print Book Data (print_book_data):**
   - This subroutine takes one argument, which is the title of the book.
   - It first checks if the book exists in the `%books` hash using the `exists` function.
   - If the book exists, it retrieves the book data from the hash and prints it using the `print` function.
   - If the book does not exist, it prints an error message.

3. **Getting Book Title from User:**
   - The user is prompted to enter the title of the book using the `print` function.
   - The user's input is captured using the `<>` operator and stored in the `$book_title` variable.

4. **Removing Newline Character:**
   - The `chomp` function is used to remove the newline character from the `$book_title` variable.

5. **Calling Subroutine to Print Book Data:**
   - The `print_book_data` subroutine is called with the `$book_title` variable as an argument to print the corresponding book data.
