# This Perl script is a complex and differentiated code that finds the longest common substring between two input strings.

# Define the input strings.
my $string1 = "ABCDGH";
my $string2 = "ACEDFH";

# Find the length of the input strings.
my $len1 = length($string1);
my $len2 = length($string2);

# Create a 2D array to store the lengths of the longest common substrings between the prefixes of the input strings.
my @lcs_lengths = [[0] * ($len2 + 1)] * ($len1 + 1);

# Populate the 2D array with the lengths of the longest common substrings.
for (my $i = 1; $i <= $len1; $i++) {
  for (my $j = 1; $j <= $len2; $j++) {
    if ($string1[$i - 1] eq $string2[$j - 1]) {
      $lcs_lengths[$i][$j] = $lcs_lengths[$i - 1][$j - 1] + 1;
    } else {
      $lcs_lengths[$i][$j] = max($lcs_lengths[$i - 1][$j], $lcs_lengths[$i][$j - 1]);
    }

# Find the length of the longest common substring.
my $lcs_length = $lcs_lengths[$len1][$len2];

# Print the length and the longest common substring.

# Explanation:
# 1. Define the input strings and find their lengths.
# 2. Create a 2D array to store the lengths of the longest common substrings between the prefixes of the input strings.
# 3. Populate the 2D array with the lengths of the longest common substrings.
# 4. Find the length of the longest common substring.
# 5. Print the length and the longest common substring.
