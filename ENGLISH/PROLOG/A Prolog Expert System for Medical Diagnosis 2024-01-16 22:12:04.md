```prolog
% This is a complex PROLOG program that implements a simple expert system.

% The program defines a number of rules that relate symptoms to diseases.
% For example, the following rule states that if a patient has a fever and a cough,
% then they may have the flu.

rule(flu, [fever, cough]).

% The program also defines a number of facts about patients.
% For example, the following fact states that patient 1 has a fever.

fact(patient1, fever).

% The program uses these rules and facts to diagnose diseases.
% For example, the following query asks the program to diagnose the disease of patient 1.

?- diagnose(patient1, Disease).

% The program responds by printing the diagnosis to the console.

% In this case, the program will print the following diagnosis:

% Disease = flu

% This program is a simple example of how PROLOG can be used to implement an expert system.
% Expert systems are computer programs that are designed to solve problems in a specific domain.
% They are often used in medical diagnosis, financial planning, and other areas where there is a need for specialized knowledge.

% The PROLOG program above is a very simple example of an expert system.
% It is not intended to be used for real-world medical diagnosis.
% However, it does illustrate how PROLOG can be used to implement expert systems.

% Here is a more detailed explanation of the PROLOG code:

% The rule/2 predicate defines a rule.
% The first argument is the name of the disease.
% The second argument is a list of symptoms.

% The fact/2 predicate defines a fact.
% The first argument is the name of the patient.
% The second argument is a symptom.

% The diagnose/2 predicate diagnoses a disease.
% The first argument is the name of the patient.
% The second argument is the name of the disease.

% The ?- operator is used to query the program.
% The comma (,) operator is used to separate goals.

% The = operator is used to unify two terms.
% The | operator is used to separate alternatives.

% The write/1 predicate prints a term to the console.
% The nl/0 predicate prints a newline to the console.
