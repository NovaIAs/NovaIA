This code is a family tree in Prolog. It defines the relationships between different people, such as parent, child, sibling, and cousin. It also includes rules for finding ancestors, descendants, siblings, and cousins.

The code starts by defining the parent-child relationships using the `parent/2` predicate. For example, `parent(alice, bob)` means that Alice is the parent of Bob.

Next, the code defines the gender of each person using the `male/1` and `female/1` predicates. For example, `male(bob)` means that Bob is male.

The code then defines rules for finding ancestors and descendants using the `ancestor/2` and `descendant/2` predicates. For example, `ancestor(alice, grace)` means that Alice is an ancestor of Grace.

The code also defines rules for finding siblings and cousins using the `sibling/2` and `cousin/2` predicates. For example, `sibling(dave, carol)` means that Dave and Carol are siblings.

Finally, the code includes a query to find all ancestors of Alice. The query `?- ancestor(alice, grace).` returns `true`, indicating that Grace is an ancestor of Alice.
