Explanation:

1. We start by defining the query that we want to solve. In this case, we want to find a combination of three distinct integers between 1 and 9 such that the sum of the squares of the first two integers is equal to the square of the third integer.

2. To find all possible combinations of three distinct integers between 1 and 9, we use the findall/3 predicate. This predicate generates a list of all solutions that satisfy a given condition. In this case, the condition is that the three integers are between 1 and 9 and are all distinct.

3. Once we have all the possible combinations, we need to filter them to find those where the sum of the squares of the first two integers is equal to the square of the third integer. To do this, we use the filter/3 predicate. This predicate takes a list of solutions and a result list as input and returns a new result list that contains only the solutions that satisfy a given condition.

4. In the filter/3 predicate, we first calculate the sum of the squares of the first two integers in the solution and the square of the third integer. Then, we check if the sum of the squares is equal to the square of the third integer. If it is, we add the solution to the result list. Otherwise, we discard the solution and continue filtering the remaining solutions.

5. Finally, we use the nth0/3 predicate to select the first solution from the result list. This gives us the answer to our query.
