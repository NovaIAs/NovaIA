This code defines a simple expert system in Prolog. The system can diagnose three diseases: migraine, vertigo, and flu. The rules for the system are defined using the `rule` predicate. The facts for the system are defined using the `fact` predicate. The query for the system is defined using the `query` predicate. The `solve` predicate uses the Prolog inference engine to find a solution to the query. The `main` predicate calls the `solve` predicate to solve the query and then halts.
