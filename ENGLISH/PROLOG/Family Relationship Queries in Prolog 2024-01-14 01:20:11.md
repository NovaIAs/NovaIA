This code defines a set of rules for representing and querying family relationships in Prolog. The rules cover a wide range of relationships, including parents, children, siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, great-grandparents, great-great-grandparents, in-laws, step-parents, step-siblings, step-children, half-siblings, and double cousins.

To use the code, you can first load it into Prolog using the consult/1 predicate:

```
?- consult('family.pl').
```

Once the code is loaded, you can use the various predicates to query the family relationships. For example, to find all of the children of a particular person, you can use the following query:

```
?- child(X, john).
```

This query will return all of the children of john, which in this case are mary and bob.

You can also use the code to find more complex relationships, such as cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents. For example, to find all of the cousins of a particular person, you can use the following query:

```
?- cousin(X, alice).
```

This query will return all of the cousins of alice, which in this case are charlie and mary.

The code can be used to answer a wide variety of questions about family relationships. It can be used to find out who is related to whom, how they are related, and what their relationship is. The code is also flexible and can be easily extended to include new types of relationships.
