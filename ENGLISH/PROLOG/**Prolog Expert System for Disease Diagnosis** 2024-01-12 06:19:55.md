This Prolog program is a simple expert system that can diagnose diseases based on a set of symptoms.
The program uses a knowledge base of diseases and their associated symptoms to make its diagnosis.

The program first asks the user to enter the symptoms of the patient.
It then uses these symptoms to generate a list of possible diseases.
The program then asks the user to enter additional information about the patient, such as their age and sex.
This information is used to further narrow down the list of possible diseases.

The program finally presents the user with a list of the most likely diseases, along with their associated symptoms.
The user can then choose the disease that they believe is most likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the program:

1. The program starts by loading the knowledge base of diseases and their associated symptoms.
This knowledge base is stored in a file called "diseases.pl".

2. The program then asks the user to enter the symptoms of the patient.
The user can enter multiple symptoms, separated by commas.

3. The program uses the symptoms entered by the user to generate a list of possible diseases.
This is done by matching the symptoms against the symptoms stored in the knowledge base.

4. The program then asks the user to enter additional information about the patient, such as their age and sex.
This information is used to further narrow down the list of possible diseases.

5. The program finally presents the user with a list of the most likely diseases, along with their associated symptoms.
The user can then choose the disease that they believe is most likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms.

This program is a simple example of how Prolog can be used to create an expert system.
Expert systems are computer programs that are designed to simulate the knowledge and reasoning abilities of human experts.
Expert systems are used in a variety of applications, such as medical diagnosis, financial planning, and legal research.

This code is a complex and differentiated Prolog program that can diagnose diseases based on a set of symptoms.
The code is divided into several parts:

1. Loading the knowledge base:
   - The program starts by loading the knowledge base of diseases and their associated symptoms.
     This knowledge base is stored in a file called "diseases.pl".

2. Getting input from the user:
   - The program then asks the user to enter the symptoms of the patient.
     The user can enter multiple symptoms, separated by commas.
   - The program also asks the user to enter additional information about the patient, such as their age and sex.

3. Generating a list of possible diseases:
   - The program uses the symptoms entered by the user to generate a list of possible diseases.
     This is done by matching the symptoms against the symptoms stored in the knowledge base.

4. Narrowing down the list of possible diseases:
   - The program uses the additional information entered by the user to further narrow down the list of possible diseases.

5. Presenting the results to the user:
   - The program finally presents the user with a list of the most likely diseases, along with their associated symptoms.
     The user can then choose the disease that they believe is most likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms.
