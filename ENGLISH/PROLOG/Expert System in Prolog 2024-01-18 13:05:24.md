This code defines a simple expert system in Prolog. The expert system can diagnose a disease based on a set of symptoms.

The code first defines the rules for the expert system. Each rule consists of a symptom and a disease. For example, the rule `rule(symptom(headache), disease(migraine))` states that if a patient has a headache, then they may have a migraine.

The code then defines the facts for the expert system. The facts are a set of symptoms that the patient has. For example, the fact `fact(symptom(headache))` states that the patient has a headache.

The code then defines the goal for the expert system. The goal is to find the disease that the patient has.

The code then uses the Prolog engine to find all possible solutions to the goal. The solutions are a set of diseases that the patient may have.

Finally, the code prints the solutions to the goal.

This code is a simple example of how Prolog can be used to develop an expert system. Expert systems are computer programs that can diagnose diseases, provide financial advice, or perform other tasks that require expert knowledge.
