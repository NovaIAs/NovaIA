```

This code defines a family tree and a set of rules for determining relationships between people in the tree. The relationships include parent, child, sibling, cousin, ancestor, descendant, and relative. The rules are defined using Prolog's built-in rules for logical inference.

To use the code, you can query the Prolog interpreter with questions about the relationships between people in the tree. For example, you could ask:

```
?- ancestor(john, tom).
```

This query would ask if John is Tom's ancestor. The Prolog interpreter would use the rules defined in the code to determine the answer to the query. In this case, the interpreter would determine that John is Tom's ancestor, and it would return "yes" as the answer to the query.

You can also use the code to generate a list of all the relatives of a particular person. For example, you could ask:

```
?- relative(john, X).
```

This query would ask for a list of all the people who are related to John. The Prolog interpreter would use the rules defined in the code to generate a list of all the people who are related to John, and it would return the list as the answer to the query.

The code provided is a very large and differentiated code that is unlikely to be repeated again. It is also a complex code that demonstrates the power of Prolog's logical inference engine.
