This Prolog code simulates a simple ghost hunting game. It includes the following features:

1. The `ghost/2` predicate is used to store information about ghosts. Each ghost has a name and a status (either `alive` or `released`).

2. The `catch_ghost/1` predicate allows the user to catch a ghost by asserting a fact that the ghost is `alive`.

3. The `release_ghost/1` predicate allows the user to release a ghost by retracting the fact that the ghost is `alive`.

4. The `list_ghosts/0` predicate lists all ghosts that are currently caught.

5. The `is_ghost_caught/1` predicate checks if a ghost is caught by checking if the ghost is `alive`.

6. The `is_ghost_released/1` predicate checks if a ghost is released by checking if the ghost is not `alive`.

7. The `user_input/0` predicate prompts the user to enter a command (catch, release, list, or quit) and handles the user's input.

8. The `handle_command/1` predicate handles the user's command by calling the appropriate predicate to catch, release, or list ghosts, or to quit the program.

9. The `main/0` predicate uses a loop to continuously prompt the user for input until the user enters the `quit` command.

This code demonstrates more advanced Prolog features such as dynamic predicates, findall, and loops, and it simulates a simple game-like interaction with the user.
