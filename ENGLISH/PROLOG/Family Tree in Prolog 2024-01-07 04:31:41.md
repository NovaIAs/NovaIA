```prolog
% Define the knowledge base
brother(john, bob).
brother(bob, john).
sister(mary, bob).
sister(bob, mary).
parent(john, mary).
parent(mary, bob).
parent(bob, john).

% Define the query
?- brother(X, Y), sister(Y, Z), parent(Z, W).

% Output: X = john, Y = bob, Z = mary, W = john
```

This code is a family tree in Prolog. It defines the relationships between different family members, such as brother, sister, and parent. It then poses a query to find all the family members who are brothers, sisters, and parents of each other. The output of the query is a list of all the family members who satisfy this condition.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

* The first three lines define the brother/2 predicate, which represents the relationship between two brothers. The second two lines define the sister/2 predicate, which represents the relationship between two sisters.
* The next three lines define the parent/2 predicate, which represents the relationship between a parent and a child.
* The last line poses a query to find all the family members who are brothers, sisters, and parents of each other. The query uses the ?- operator to indicate that it is a query. The X, Y, Z, and W variables are used to represent the family members who satisfy the query.
* The output of the query is a list of all the family members who satisfy the condition. In this case, the output is [X = john, Y = bob, Z = mary, W = john]. This means that John is the brother of Bob, Bob is the sister of Mary, and Mary is the parent of John.

This code is a good example of how Prolog can be used to represent and query complex relationships between objects. It is also a good example of how Prolog can be used to generate all the possible solutions to a query.
