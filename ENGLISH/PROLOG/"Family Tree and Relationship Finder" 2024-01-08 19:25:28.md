This code defines a family tree and a set of rules for finding relationships between people in the tree. The relationships include parent, child, sibling, cousin, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, and in-law.

The code uses Prolog's built-in unification mechanism to match facts and rules. For example, the following query would find all of Mary's descendants:

```prolog
?- descendant(mary, X).
X = alice
X = tom
X = sue
X = joe
```

The code also uses Prolog's built-in negation operator (\+) to exclude certain possibilities. For example, the following query would find all of John's siblings who are not named Mary:

```prolog
?- sibling(john, X), X \= mary.
X = bob
```

This code could be used to build a family tree application or to perform genealogical research.
