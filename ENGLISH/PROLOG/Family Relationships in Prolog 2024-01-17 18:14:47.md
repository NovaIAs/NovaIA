% Define a knowledge base of facts and rules.

% Facts:
mother(mary, john).
father(john, bob).
brother(bob, alice).
sister(alice, bob).

% Rules:
% A person is a parent of their child.
parent(X, Y) :- mother(X, Y).
parent(X, Y) :- father(X, Y).

% A person is a grandparent of their grandchild.
grandparent(X, Z) :- parent(X, Y), parent(Y, Z).

% A person is a sibling of another person if they have the same parent.
sibling(X, Y) :- parent(Z, X), parent(Z, Y), X \= Y.

% A person is an aunt or uncle of their niece or nephew.
aunt_or_uncle(X, Y) :- sibling(X, Z), parent(Z, Y), X \= Z.

% A person is a cousin of another person if they have a common grandparent.
cousin(X, Y) :- grandparent(Z, X), grandparent(Z, Y), X \= Y.

% Queries:

% Find all of John's parents.
?- parent(X, john).

% Find all of Bob's grandparents.
?- grandparent(X, bob).

% Find all of Alice's siblings.
?- sibling(alice, X).

% Find all of Mary's aunts or uncles.
?- aunt_or_uncle(X, mary).

% Find all of John's cousins.
?- cousin(john, X).

Explanation:

This Prolog code defines a knowledge base of facts and rules about family relationships. The facts include information about who is the mother, father, brother, and sister of each person. The rules define how to infer new relationships from the facts. For example, the rule `parent(X, Y) :- mother(X, Y).` defines that a person is a parent of their child if they are the mother of the child.

The queries at the end of the code demonstrate how to use the knowledge base to answer questions about family relationships. For example, the query `?- cousin(john, X).` finds all of John's cousins.

This code is complex and differentiated because it uses a combination of facts and rules to represent and infer family relationships. It also uses a variety of different Prolog constructs, such as variables, functors, and rules. This makes it a challenging code to understand and modify, but it also makes it a powerful tool for representing and reasoning about complex relationships.
