This code defines a family tree in Prolog. It includes relations for child, parent, ancestor, father, mother, male, female, grandparent, great_grandparent, sibling, cousin, aunt, and uncle.

The code uses dynamic predicates, which means that the relations can be modified at runtime. This allows the family tree to be updated as new family members are added or removed.

The code also uses recursion to define the ancestor and grandparent relations. This allows the code to find all of the ancestors and grandparents of a given person, even if they are many generations removed.

The code is quite complex, but it is also very powerful. It can be used to answer a variety of questions about family relationships. For example, you could use the code to find all of the cousins of a given person, or to find the great-grandparents of a given person.
