Explanation:

This Prolog code defines a complex set of family and relationship rules. It includes relations such as family, friend, sibling, cousin, grandparent, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, male, female, parent, and child.

These relations are defined using Prolog facts and rules. Facts are statements that are assumed to be true, while rules are used to derive new facts from existing ones.

For example, the fact family(john, mary) states that John and Mary are family members. The rule sibling(X, Y) :- family(X, Z), family(Y, Z), X \= Y. derives the fact that X and Y are siblings if they are both family members of the same person Z, and they are not the same person.

This code allows us to query the family and relationship relations using Prolog's query mechanism. For example, we can ask queries such as:

```prolog
?- sibling(john, alice).
```

which returns

```prolog
true.
```

indicating that John and Alice are siblings.

This code is complex and covers a wide range of family and relationship relations. It demonstrates the expressive power of Prolog for representing and reasoning about complex knowledge domains.
