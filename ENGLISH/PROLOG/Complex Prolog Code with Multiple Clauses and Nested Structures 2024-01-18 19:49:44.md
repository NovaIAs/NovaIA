Explanation:

1. **Complex Predicate**: The `complex_predicate/4` is the main predicate that takes four arguments `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`. It is defined with multiple clauses that check different conditions on these arguments.

2. **First Clause**: The first clause checks if `A` is a list and the lengths of `B` and `C` are equal. If this condition is met, it succeeds and moves to the next clause.

3. **Second Clause**: The second clause checks if `B` is a singleton list (a list with only one element). If this condition is met, it succeeds and moves to the next clause.

4. **Third Clause**: The third clause checks if `C` is a list containing only integers. It uses the helper predicate `integer/1` to check if each element of `C` is an integer. If this condition is met, it succeeds and moves to the next clause.

5. **Fourth Clause**: The fourth clause checks if `D` is a compound term (a term with a functor and arguments) with a functor `f` and two arguments. If this condition is met, it succeeds and moves to the next clause.

6. **Fifth Clause**: The fifth clause checks if the first argument of `D` (denoted as `D1`) is a variable. If this condition is met, it succeeds and unifies `D` with the compound term `f(D1, D2)`.

7. **Helper Predicates**: The code also defines three helper predicates:

   - `is_list/1`: Checks if a term is a list.
   - `integer/1`: Checks if a term is an integer.
   - `all/2`: Checks if all elements of a list satisfy a given condition.

This code demonstrates several advanced Prolog features, including pattern matching, multiple clauses, compound terms, variables, and helper predicates. It is a complex and differentiated code that would be difficult to find repeated elsewhere.
