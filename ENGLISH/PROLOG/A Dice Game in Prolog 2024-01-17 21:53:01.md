Explanation:

This Prolog code defines a game of dice between two players. The game is played by rolling two dice and adding the values of the dice together. The player with the highest total wins the round. The code includes the following features:

1. **Random Number Generation**: It uses the `random_number/1` predicate to generate random numbers between 1 and 10. This is used to simulate the rolling of dice.

2. **Game Rules**: The `play_dice/2` predicate defines the rules for playing a single round of the dice game. It generates two random numbers, calculates the total scores, and determines the winner.

3. **Multiple Rounds**: The `play_dice/3` predicate allows the game to be played for a specified number of rounds. It initializes the scores, plays each round, and keeps track of the wins for each player.

4. **Results Display**: The `display_results/4` predicate displays the results of the game, showing the number of wins for each player.

5. **Main Goal**: The `main/0` predicate is the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to enter the players' names and the number of rounds to play. It then plays the game and displays the results.

To use this code, you can consult the Prolog file containing the code and then run the `main/0` goal. The program will prompt you to enter the players' names and the number of rounds to play. After the game is played, it will display the results.
