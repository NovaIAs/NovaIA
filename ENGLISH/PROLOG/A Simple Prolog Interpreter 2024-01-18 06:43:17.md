This code implements a simple Prolog interpreter.

The `fact/2` predicate is used to store facts about the world. For example, the fact `fact(sky, blue)` states that the sky is blue.

The `rule/2` predicate is used to store rules that can be used to infer new facts. For example, the rule `rule(hot_day, [sun, hot])` states that a day is hot if the sun is out and it is hot.

The `query/1` predicate is used to ask questions about the world. For example, the query `query(nice_day)` would return `true` if it is a nice day, and `false` otherwise.

The `call/1` predicate is used to invoke a goal. For example, the goal `call(fact(sky, blue))` would return `true` if the sky is blue, and `false` otherwise.

The `findall/3` predicate is used to collect all the solutions to a goal. For example, the goal `findall(X, call(fact(X, blue)), X)` would return a list of all the things that are blue.

The `setof/3` predicate is used to collect all the solutions to a goal, without duplicates. For example, the goal `setof(X, call(fact(X, blue)), X)` would return a list of all the unique things that are blue.

The `bagof/3` predicate is used to collect all the solutions to a goal, with duplicates. For example, the goal `bagof(X, call(fact(X, blue)), X)` would return a list of all the things that are blue, including duplicates.

The `sort/2` predicate is used to sort a list of terms. For example, the goal `sort([1, 3, 2], X)` would return the list `[1, 2, 3]`.

The `partition/4` predicate is used to partition a list of terms into two lists, one containing the terms that are less than or equal to the pivot, and the other containing the terms that are greater than the pivot. For example, the goal `partition(2, [1, 3, 2, 4], X, Y)` would return the lists `[1, 2]` and `[3, 4]`.
