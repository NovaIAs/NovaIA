This code is a complex Prolog program that defines a knowledge base of facts and rules about people and their relationships. It includes queries to find all siblings of a given person, all people who are both parents and siblings, all people who have at least one child who is also a parent, all people who have at least one child and at least one sibling, and all people who have at least one child, at least one sibling, and at least one parent who is also a sibling. The last query is the most complex and finds all people who have at least one child, at least one sibling, at least one parent who is also a sibling, and at least one grandparent who is also a sibling.

To use this code, you can load it into a Prolog interpreter and then issue queries to it. For example, to find all siblings of Mary, you would issue the following query:

```
siblings_of(mary, Siblings).
```

This query would return a list of all of Mary's siblings.

This code is a good example of how Prolog can be used to represent complex relationships and to answer queries about them.
