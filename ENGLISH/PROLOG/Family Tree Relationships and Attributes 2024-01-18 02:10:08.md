This code defines a family tree with multiple generations and relationships, including parents, children, and grandchildren. It also includes information about each person's gender, age, occupation, and city of residence.

The code includes several rules to define the relationships between people, such as parent-child relationships and relatedness. It also includes rules to find all people related to a given person, those who are related and have the same gender, those who are related and older than a given age, those who are related and live in the same city, and those who are related and have the same occupation.

This code demonstrates the power of PROLOG for representing and reasoning about complex relationships and data. It can be used to answer various questions about the family tree, such as who is related to whom, who is the oldest person, who lives in the same city as someone else, and who has the same occupation as someone else.
