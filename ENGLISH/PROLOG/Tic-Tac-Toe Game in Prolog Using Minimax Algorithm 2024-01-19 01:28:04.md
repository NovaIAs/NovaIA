 * Prolog program to play Tic-Tac-Toe.

 * This program uses a minimax algorithm to play Tic-Tac-Toe.
 * The minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm that evaluates
 * all possible moves for both players and chooses the move that
 * is most likely to lead to a win.
 *
 * The program uses a database of Tic-Tac-Toe games to learn
 * how to play the game. The database contains a large number of
 * games that have been played by human players. The program
 * uses this database to learn the strategies that are most likely
 * to lead to a win.
 *
 * The program can be played against a human player or against
 * itself. To play against a human player, simply start the program
 * and type 'play' at the prompt. To play against the computer,
 * type 'computer' at the prompt.

This code is a Prolog program that plays Tic-Tac-Toe. The program uses a minimax algorithm to play the game, which means that it evaluates all possible moves for both players and chooses the move that is most likely to lead to a win. The program can be played against a human player or against itself.

The program uses a database of Tic-Tac-Toe games to learn how to play the game. The database contains a large number of games that have been played by human players. The program uses this database to learn the strategies that are most likely to lead to a win.

The program is played in a loop. Each turn, the player who is next to move makes a move. The move is made by entering the row and column of the square that the player wants to place their marker in. The program then checks if the move is valid, and if it is, the program makes the move.

The program checks if the game is over after each move. If the game is over, the program prints the winner of the game. If the game is not over, the program continues to the next turn.

This code is a complex and sophisticated example of a Prolog program. It uses a variety of techniques, including recursion, dynamic programming, and learning from a database. The code is also well-commented, making it easy to understand and modify.
