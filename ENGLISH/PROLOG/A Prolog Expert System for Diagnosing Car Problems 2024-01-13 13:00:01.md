/*
This Prolog program implements a simple expert system for diagnosing car problems.
The program uses a knowledge base of facts and rules to infer the most likely cause of a problem, given a set of symptoms.

The knowledge base is represented as a set of clauses. Clauses are made up of a head and a body.
The head of a clause is a single predicate, while the body is a conjunction of predicates.
For example, the following clause states that if a car has a dead battery, it will not start:

```
dead_battery :- not(starts).
```

```
The program also includes a set of rules that can be used to infer the cause of a problem.
For example, the following rule states that if a car has a dead battery and the lights are on, then the most likely cause of the problem is a faulty alternator:

```
faulty_alternator :- dead_battery, lights_on.
```

The program uses a backward-chaining inference engine to diagnose problems.
The inference engine starts by selecting a goal, which is a predicate that represents the problem that is being diagnosed.
The inference engine then searches the knowledge base for clauses whose heads match the goal.
If a clause is found, the inference engine uses the body of the clause to generate new goals.
This process continues until a solution is found, or until all possible solutions have been exhausted.

The following is an example of how the program would diagnose a problem with a car that will not start:

```
?- diagnose(not(starts)).
```

```
The inference engine would start by selecting the goal `not(starts)`.
It would then search the knowledge base for clauses whose heads match the goal `not(starts)`.
It would find the following clause:

```
dead_battery :- not(starts).
```

The inference engine would then use the body of the clause to generate a new goal: `dead_battery`.
It would then search the knowledge base for clauses whose heads match the goal `dead_battery`.
It would find the following clause:

```
dead_battery :- faulty_alternator.
```

The inference engine would then use the body of the clause to generate a new goal: `faulty_alternator`.
It would then search the knowledge base for clauses whose heads match the goal `faulty_alternator`.
It would find the following clause:

```
faulty_alternator :- dead_battery, lights_on.
```

The inference engine would then check the current state of the car to see if the lights are on.
If the lights are on, then the inference engine would conclude that the most likely cause of the problem is a faulty alternator.
If the lights are off, then the inference engine would generate a new goal: `not(lights_on)`.
It would then search the knowledge base for clauses whose heads match the goal `not(lights_on)`.
It would find the following clause:

```
not(lights_on) :- lights_off.
```

The inference engine would then conclude that the lights are off, and that the most likely cause of the problem is a dead battery.
