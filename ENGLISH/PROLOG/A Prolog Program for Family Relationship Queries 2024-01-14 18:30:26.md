This code is a complex and differentiated Prolog program that defines a knowledge base of facts and rules about family relationships. The program can answer queries about whether two people are related, such as whether someone is an ancestor or descendant of another person, whether two people are siblings or cousins, or whether someone is a step-parent or step-child of another person. The program also includes facts about marriages and can answer queries about whether two people are in-laws.

The program uses a combination of facts and rules to answer queries. Facts are statements that are known to be true, such as the fact that John is the parent of Mary and Bob. Rules are statements that specify how to derive new facts from existing facts. For example, the rule for determining if someone is an ancestor of another person states that if X is the parent of Y, then X is an ancestor of Y.

The program uses the findall/3 predicate to find all of the possible solutions to a query. For example, the query ancestor(john, alice) asks the program to find all of the people who are ancestors of Alice. The program uses the findall/3 predicate to find all of the possible solutions to this query and then prints the results.

The program also uses the writeln/1 predicate to print the results of queries to the knowledge base. The writeln/1 predicate prints a string to the console, followed by a newline character.

The main/0 predicate is the entry point for the program. The main/0 predicate calls the query/1 predicate to ask the program a series of queries about family relationships. The results of the queries are printed to the console.
