This code implements a simple Prolog knowledge base. The knowledge base consists of a set of rules and facts. Rules are of the form `Head :- Body`, where `Head` is a goal and `Body` is a sequence of goals. Facts are of the form `Fact`, where `Fact` is a proposition.

The `add_rule/2` and `add_fact/1` predicates are used to add new rules and facts to the knowledge base, respectively. The `query/1` predicate is used to query the knowledge base. The `prove/1` predicate is used to prove a goal. The `prove_body/1` predicate is used to prove a conjunction of goals. The `print_knowledge_base/0` predicate is used to print the knowledge base.

This code can be used to build a variety of knowledge-based systems, such as expert systems, natural language processing systems, and theorem provers.
