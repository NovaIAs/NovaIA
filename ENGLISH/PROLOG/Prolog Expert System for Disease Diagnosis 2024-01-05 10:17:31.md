% Define the goal for the expert system.
goal(disease(X)).

% Use the Prolog engine to find a solution to the goal.
?- goal(X).

% Explanation of the code:
% 1. The rule/2 predicate defines the rules for the expert system. Each rule consists of a symptom and a corresponding disease.
% 2. The fact/1 predicate defines the facts for the expert system. Each fact is a symptom that the patient is experiencing.
% 3. The goal/1 predicate defines the goal for the expert system. In this case, the goal is to find the disease that the patient has.
% 4. The ?- operator is used to query the Prolog engine. The goal(X) query asks the Prolog engine to find a solution for the goal, where X is the disease that the patient has.
% 5. The Prolog engine uses the rules and facts to find a solution to the goal. If a solution is found, the Prolog engine will print the solution to the console.
```
This code is an example of a simple expert system in Prolog. The expert system is designed to diagnose diseases based on a patient's symptoms. The system consists of a set of rules that define the relationship between symptoms and diseases, a set of facts that describe the patient's symptoms, and a goal that specifies the disease that the system is trying to diagnose.

The Prolog engine uses the rules and facts to find a solution to the goal. If a solution is found, the Prolog engine will print the solution to the console.

This code is a good example of how Prolog can be used to solve complex problems in a declarative way. The rules and facts are written in a natural language-like syntax, which makes the code easy to understand and maintain. The Prolog engine then uses its built-in inference engine to find a solution to the goal.
