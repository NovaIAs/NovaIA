This code implements a simple Prolog knowledge base system with the following capabilities:

* Adding facts to the knowledge base
* Retracting facts from the knowledge base
* Checking if a fact exists in the knowledge base
* Listing all facts in the knowledge base
* Adding rules to the knowledge base
* Retracting rules from the knowledge base
* Checking if a rule exists in the knowledge base
* Listing all rules in the knowledge base
* Querying the knowledge base using a goal
* Resetting the knowledge base by retracting all facts and rules
* Populating the knowledge base with some initial facts and rules

The code also includes a sample query to find all birds that can fly.

To use this code, you can load it into a Prolog interpreter and then use the various predicates to interact with the knowledge base. For example, you could use the following commands to add a new fact to the knowledge base:

```
assertFact(bird(polly)).
```

You could then use the following command to query the knowledge base to find all birds:

```
query(bird(X)).
```

This would return the following result:

```
X = tweety
X = bigbird
X = polly
```

You can also use the following command to reset the knowledge base:

```
resetKnowledgeBase.
```

This would remove all facts and rules from the knowledge base.
