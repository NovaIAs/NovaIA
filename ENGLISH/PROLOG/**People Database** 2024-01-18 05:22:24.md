**Explanation:**

This Prolog code defines a set of rules and facts to represent information about people, including their names, ages, and occupations. It also defines rules to perform various queries on this information, such as finding people with a given occupation, people who are older or younger than a given age, and people who have a specified name or occupation.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- **Facts:**

```
person("John Smith", 30, "Software Engineer").
person("Jane Doe", 25, "Doctor").
person("Peter Jones", 40, "Teacher").
```

These facts assert information about specific people, including their names, ages, and occupations.

- **Rules:**

```
occupation(Occupation, Person) :-
    person(Person, _, Occupation).
```

This rule finds people with the given occupation. It uses the `person/3` predicate to find a person with the specified occupation and returns their name as the second argument.

```
older_than(Age, Person) :-
    person(Person, Age1, _),
    Age1 > Age.
```

This rule finds people who are older than the given age. It uses the `person/3` predicate to find a person with a certain age and then checks if that person's age is greater than the given age.

```
younger_than(Age, Person) :-
    person(Person, Age1, _),
    Age1 < Age.
```

This rule finds people who are younger than the given age. It uses the `person/3` predicate to find a person with a certain age and then checks if that person's age is less than the given age.

```
name(Name, Person) :-
    person(Person, _, _),
    Name = Person.
```

This rule finds people with a given name. It uses the `person/3` predicate to find a person with any age and occupation and then checks if that person's name matches the given name.

```
older_than_and_occupation(Age, Occupation, Person) :-
    person(Person, Age1, Occupation),
    Age1 > Age.
```

This rule finds people who are both older than a given age and have a given occupation. It uses the `person/3` predicate to find a person with the given occupation and then checks if that person's age is greater than the given age.

```
younger_than_and_occupation(Age, Occupation, Person) :-
    person(Person, Age1, Occupation),
    Age1 < Age.
```

This rule finds people who are both younger than a given age and have a given occupation. It uses the `person/3` predicate to find a person with the given occupation and then checks if that person's age is less than the given age.

```
name_and_occupation(Name, Occupation, Person) :-
    person(Person, _, Occupation),
    Name = Person.
```

This rule finds people who have both a given name and a given occupation. It uses the `person/3` predicate to find a person with the given occupation and then checks if that person's name matches the given name.

By combining these rules and facts, you can perform various queries to extract specific information about people from the knowledge base.
