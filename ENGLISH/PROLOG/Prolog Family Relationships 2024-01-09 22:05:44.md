This code defines a set of rules for representing family relationships in Prolog. It includes rules for determining if someone is a parent, child, sibling, grandparent, cousin, uncle or aunt, nephew or niece, brother-in-law or sister-in-law, father-in-law or mother-in-law, and son-in-law or daughter-in-law.

The code uses a combination of facts and rules to represent the family relationships. The facts define the gender of each person and the parent-child relationships. The rules define the other relationships based on these facts.

For example, the rule for checking if someone is a grandparent is defined as follows:

```
grandparent(X, Y) :-
    parent(X, Z),
    parent(Z, Y).
```

This rule states that if X is a parent of Z and Z is a parent of Y, then X is a grandparent of Y.

The code can be used to answer questions about family relationships. For example, the following query would return the names of all of John's grandchildren:

```
?- grandparent(john, X).
```

This query would return the following results:

```
X = alice
X = david
X = charlie
```

The code can also be used to generate family trees. A family tree is a diagram that shows the relationships between family members. The following query would generate a family tree for the family defined in the code:

```
?- family_tree.
```

This query would generate the following family tree:

```
           john
          /   \
         mary  bob
        /      \
      alice    charlie
       \
        david
```
