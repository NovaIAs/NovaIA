This Prolog program implements a simple expert system for diagnosing car problems. The program first defines the rules of the expert system, which are represented as facts in the Prolog database. Each rule consists of a problem, a cause, and a solution. The program also defines the symptoms of the car problems and the questions to ask the user.

The main loop of the expert system repeatedly asks the user a question, gets the user's input, processes the answer, and prints the problem. The program uses the Prolog built-in predicates `ask_question`, `get_user_input`, and `process_answer` to ask the user questions and get their input. The program uses the Prolog built-in predicate `print_problem` to print the problem.

This program can be used to diagnose car problems by asking the user a series of questions about the symptoms of the problem. The program will then print the problem, the cause of the problem, and the solution to the problem.
