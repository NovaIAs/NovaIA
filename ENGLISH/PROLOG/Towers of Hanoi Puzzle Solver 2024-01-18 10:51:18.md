% A Prolog program to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.

% The main predicate, hanoi/3, takes three arguments:
%   - N: the number of disks
%   - From: the starting peg
%   - To: the destination peg

hanoi(N, From, To) :-
  % If there is only one disk, move it directly from the starting peg to the destination peg.
  ( N = 1 -> move(From, To)
  ;
    % Otherwise, we need to use a third peg as an intermediate staging area.
    Aux = 6 - From - To,

    % Recursively move N-1 disks from the starting peg to the auxiliary peg.
    hanoi(N-1, From, Aux),

    % Move the remaining disk from the starting peg to the destination peg.
    move(From, To),

    % Recursively move N-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.
    hanoi(N-1, Aux, To)
  ).

% The move/2 predicate moves a single disk from one peg to another.

move(From, To) :-
  write('Move disk from '), write(From), write(' to '), write(To), nl.

% The main program starts by solving the puzzle with 3 disks.

main :-
  hanoi(3, 1, 3).
```

This code solves the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, a classic puzzle involving three pegs and a stack of disks of different sizes. The goal is to move all of the disks from one peg to another, following certain rules:
- You can only move one disk at a time.
- You can only move a disk to a peg that is either empty or contains a larger disk.

The program uses a recursive algorithm to solve the puzzle. The main predicate, hanoi/3, takes three arguments: the number of disks, the starting peg, and the destination peg. It recursively moves the disks from the starting peg to the destination peg, using an auxiliary peg as an intermediate staging area. The move/2 predicate moves a single disk from one peg to another.

The program starts by solving the puzzle with 3 disks. You can change this number to solve the puzzle with a different number of disks.
