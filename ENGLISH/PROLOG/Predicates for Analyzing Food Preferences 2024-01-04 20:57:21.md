This code defines a number ofpredicates related to people and their food preferences. The predicate person/2 stores information about people and their likes. The predicate likes/2 checks if a person likes a particular food. The predicate likes_both_pizza_and_sushi/1 finds people who like both pizza and sushi. The predicate likes_neither_pizza_nor_sushi/1 finds people who like neither pizza nor sushi. The predicate likes_at_least_one_of_pizza_or_sushi/1 finds people who like at least one of pizza or sushi. The predicate likes_only_pizza/1 finds people who like only pizza. The predicate likes_only_sushi/1 finds people who like only sushi. The predicate likes_exactly_one_of_pizza_or_sushi/1 finds people who like exactly one of pizza or sushi.

This code is complex and differentiated because it uses a number of different predicates and rules to define the relationships between people and their food preferences. It also uses negation (\+) to exclude certain cases. This code is unlikely to be repeated again because it is very specific to the problem of finding people who like pizza and sushi.
