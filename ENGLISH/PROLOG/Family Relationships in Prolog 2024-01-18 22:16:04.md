This Prolog code defines a knowledge base of facts and rules about family relationships, and provides a number of goals that can be used to query the knowledge base and find information about family relationships.

The facts in the knowledge base include:

* `parent(X, Y)`: X is a parent of Y.
* `male(X)`: X is a male.
* `female(X)`: X is a female.

The rules in the knowledge base include:

* `ancestor(X, Y)`: X is an ancestor of Y.
* `descendant(X, Y)`: X is a descendant of Y.
* `related(X, Y)`: X is related to Y.
* `common_ancestors(X, Y, List)`: List contains the common ancestors of X and Y.
* `common_descendants(X, Y, List)`: List contains the common descendants of X and Y.
* `closest_common_ancestor(X, Y, A)`: A is the closest common ancestor of X and Y.

The goals that can be used to query the knowledge base include:

* `ancestors(X, List)`: Find all the ancestors of X.
* `descendants(X, List)`: Find all the descendants of X.
* `relatives(X, List)`: Find all the relatives of X.
* `common_ancestors(X, Y, List)`: Find the common ancestors of X and Y.
* `common_descendants(X, Y, List)`: Find the common descendants of X and Y.
* `closest_common_ancestor(X, Y, A)`: Find the closest common ancestor of X and Y.

To use the code, you can load it into a Prolog interpreter and then use the goals to query the knowledge base. For example, the following query finds all the ancestors of John:

```prolog
?- ancestors(john, List).
```

The output of this query would be:

```prolog
List = [john, mary, bob]
```

This shows that John's ancestors are John himself, Mary (his mother), and Bob (his father).
