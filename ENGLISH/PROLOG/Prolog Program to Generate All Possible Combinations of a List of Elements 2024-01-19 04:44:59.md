Explanation:

The Prolog code defines two helper predicates, `combinations/3` and `combine/3`, which are used to generate all possible combinations of a given list of elements. The `combinations/3` predicate takes a list of elements, a list of combinations, and a list of remaining elements. It generates all possible combinations of the elements in the list, and adds them to the list of combinations. The `combine/3` predicate takes a list of combinations, a list of elements, and a list of remaining elements. It combines the combinations in the list with the elements in the list, and adds the resulting combinations to the list of remaining elements.

The `print_combinations/1` predicate is used to print all possible combinations of a given list of elements. It calls the `combinations/3` predicate to generate all possible combinations, and then prints each combination.

The example at the end of the code generates and prints all possible combinations of the list `[1, 2, 3]`. The output of the program is:

```
[1,2,3]
[1,3,2]
[2,1,3]
[2,3,1]
[3,1,2]
[3,2,1]
```
