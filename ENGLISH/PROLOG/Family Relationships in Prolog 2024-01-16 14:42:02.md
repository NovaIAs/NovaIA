This code defines a simple knowledge base about family relationships. It includes facts about who is the mother and father of each person, as well as rules for reasoning about relationships such as grandparent and sibling. The queries at the end of the code demonstrate how to use the knowledge base to answer questions about relationships between people.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

* The first line of the code defines the module that the code belongs to. In this case, the module is named `family`.
* The next few lines define facts about the world. These facts are represented as Prolog clauses. A clause consists of a head and a body. The head of a clause is a single atom, while the body of a clause is a sequence of atoms separated by commas. For example, the clause `mother(mary, john)` states that Mary is the mother of John.
* The next few lines define rules for reasoning about the world. These rules are also represented as Prolog clauses. The head of a rule is a single atom, while the body of a rule is a sequence of atoms separated by commas. For example, the rule `parent(X, Y) :- mother(X, Y).` states that a person X is a parent of a person Y if X is the mother of Y.
* The last few lines of the code define queries. A query is a Prolog clause that is used to ask a question about the knowledge base. For example, the query `?- parent(mary, _).` asks the question "Is Mary a parent?"
* The Prolog interpreter will answer the query by searching the knowledge base for clauses that match the head of the query. If it finds a clause that matches the head of the query, it will try to unify the body of the query with the body of the clause. If it is able to unify the two bodies, then the query is successful and the interpreter will print the answer. If it is not able to unify the two bodies, then the query is unsuccessful and the interpreter will print "false".

This is just a simple example of how to use Prolog to represent and reason about knowledge. Prolog is a very powerful language that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems.
