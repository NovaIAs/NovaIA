 * Prolog program to find all the Hamiltonian paths in a graph.
 *
 * A Hamiltonian path is a path in a graph that visits every vertex exactly once.
 *
 * The program uses a depth-first search algorithm to find all the Hamiltonian paths.
 * The algorithm starts at a given vertex and visits all the vertices that are adjacent
 * to it. If a vertex has no adjacent vertices, the algorithm backtracks to the previous
 * vertex and tries a different path.
 *
 * The program uses a stack to keep track of the vertices that have been visited.
 * The stack is initialized with the starting vertex. The algorithm then visits all the
 * vertices that are adjacent to the top of the stack. If a vertex has no adjacent
 * vertices, the algorithm pops the top of the stack and tries a different path.
 *
 * The program uses a set to keep track of the vertices that have been visited. The set is
 * initialized with the empty set. The algorithm then adds each vertex to the set as it is
 * visited.
 *
 * The program uses a list to store the Hamiltonian paths that it finds. The list is
 * initialized with the empty list. The algorithm then adds each Hamiltonian path to the
 * list as it is found.
 *
 * The program uses a predicate called `hamiltonian_path/2` to find all the Hamiltonian
 * paths in a graph. The first argument to `hamiltonian_path/2` is the starting vertex
 * of the path. The second argument is the list of Hamiltonian paths that the program
 * finds.
 *
 * The `hamiltonian_path/2` predicate uses a recursive algorithm to find all the Hamiltonian
 * paths in a graph. The algorithm starts at the given vertex and visits all the vertices
 * that are adjacent to it. If a vertex has no adjacent vertices, the algorithm backtracks
 * to the previous vertex and tries a different path.
 *
 * The `hamiltonian_path/2` predicate uses a stack to keep track of the vertices that have
 * been visited. The stack is initialized with the starting vertex. The algorithm then visits
 * all the vertices that are adjacent to the top of the stack. If a vertex has no adjacent
 * vertices, the algorithm pops the top of the stack and tries a different path.
 *
 * The `hamiltonian_path/2` predicate uses a set to keep track of the vertices that have
 * been visited. The set is initialized with the empty set. The algorithm then adds each
 * vertex to the set as it is visited.
 *
 * The `hamiltonian_path/2` predicate uses a list to store the Hamiltonian paths that it
 * finds. The list is initialized with the empty list. The algorithm then adds each
 * Hamiltonian path to the list as it is found.
 *
 * The `hamiltonian_path/2` predicate uses a predicate called `visit/3` to visit a vertex.
 * The first argument to `visit/3` is the vertex to be visited. The second argument is the
 * stack of vertices that have been visited. The third argument is the set of vertices
 * that have been visited.
 *
 * The `visit/3` predicate adds the given vertex to the stack and the set of visited vertices.
 * The predicate then visits all the vertices that are adjacent to the given vertex. If a
 * vertex has no adjacent vertices, the predicate pops the top of the stack and tries a
 * different path.
 *
 * The `hamiltonian_path/2` predicate uses a predicate called `unvisit/3` to unvisit a vertex.
 * The first argument to `unvisit/3` is the vertex to be unvisited. The second argument is
 * the stack of vertices that have been visited. The third argument is the set of vertices
 * that have been visited.
 *
 * The `unvisit/3` predicate removes the given vertex from the stack and the set of visited
 * vertices. The predicate then unvisits all the vertices that are adjacent to the given
 * vertex.

This code is a Prolog program to find all the Hamiltonian paths in a graph. A Hamiltonian path is a path in a graph that visits every vertex exactly once. The program uses a depth-first search algorithm to find all the Hamiltonian paths. The algorithm starts at a given vertex and visits all the vertices that are adjacent to it. If a vertex has no adjacent vertices, the algorithm backtracks to the previous vertex and tries a different path.

The program uses a stack to keep track of the vertices that have been visited. The stack is initialized with the starting vertex. The algorithm then visits all the vertices that are adjacent to the top of the stack. If a vertex has no adjacent vertices, the algorithm pops the top of the stack and tries a different path.

The program uses a set to keep track of the vertices that have been visited. The set is initialized with the empty set. The algorithm then adds each vertex to the set as it is visited.
