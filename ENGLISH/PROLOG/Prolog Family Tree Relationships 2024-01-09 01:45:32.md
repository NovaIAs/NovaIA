This code defines a family tree in Prolog. It includes relationships such as parent, child, sibling, cousin, aunt, uncle, grandparent, great-grandparent, great-great-grandparent, in-law, step-parent, step-sibling, half-sibling, adopted child, and biological parent.

The code uses Prolog's built-in unification and recursion to define the relationships. For example, the rule for finding ancestors (ancestor/2) states that X is an ancestor of Y if X is a parent of Y or if X is a parent of some other ancestor of Y.

The code can be used to answer questions about family relationships. For example, the query ?- ancestor(john, alice) would return true, because John is Alice's grandfather.

This code is complex because it includes a variety of different relationships and rules. It is also large because it includes definitions for all of the different relationships. However, the code is also well-organized and easy to understand, thanks to Prolog's built-in unification and recursion.
