```prolog
% This Prolog program implements a simple expert system for medical diagnosis.

% The program contains a knowledge base of facts and rules about diseases and their symptoms.
% The program can be used to diagnose a disease based on the symptoms that the user reports.

% The knowledge base is represented using Prolog facts and rules.
% Facts are represented as assertions of the form "predicate(argument1, argument2, ...)".
% Rules are represented as implications of the form "head :- body".

% Here are some sample facts and rules from the knowledge base:

% Facts about diseases:

disease(cold, "Common Cold").
disease(flu, "Influenza").
disease(pneumonia, "Pneumonia").
disease(tuberculosis, "Tuberculosis").

% Facts about symptoms:

symptom(cough, "Cough").
symptom(fever, "Fever").
symptom(headache, "Headache").
symptom(sore_throat, "Sore Throat").
symptom(fatigue, "Fatigue").

% Rules for diagnosing diseases:

rule(cold, [symptom(cough), symptom(sore_throat)]).
rule(flu, [symptom(fever), symptom(headache), symptom(fatigue)]).
rule(pneumonia, [symptom(cough), symptom(fever), symptom(shortness_of_breath)]).
rule(tuberculosis, [symptom(cough), symptom(weight_loss), symptom(night_sweats)]).

% The program uses a backward-chaining inference engine to diagnose diseases.
% The inference engine starts with the goal of diagnosing a disease and then tries to prove the goal by matching the goal against the facts and rules in the knowledge base.
% If the inference engine succeeds in proving the goal, then the program prints the diagnosis.

% Here is the main loop of the program:

main :-
    write('Enter your symptoms (e.g., cough, fever, headache): '),
    read_line_to_codes(user_input, Codes),
    atom_codes(Symptoms, Codes),
    diagnose(Symptoms).

% The diagnose/1 predicate uses the inference engine to diagnose a disease.
% The predicate takes a list of symptoms as input and prints the diagnosis.

diagnose(Symptoms) :-
    findall(Disease, (rule(Disease, Symptoms)), Diseases),
    (   Diseases = [] ->
        write('No diagnosis could be made.')
    ;   write('The following diseases are possible: '),
        write(Diseases)
    ).

% The read_line_to_codes/2 predicate reads a line of input from the user and converts it to a list of character codes.

read_line_to_codes(Stream, Codes) :-
    get_code(Stream, Code),
    (   Code == -1 ->
        Codes = []
    ;   Codes = [Code | Codes0],
        read_line_to_codes(Stream, Codes0)
    ).
```

This program is a simple expert system for medical diagnosis.
The program contains a knowledge base of facts and rules about diseases and their symptoms.
The program can be used to diagnose a disease based on the symptoms that the user reports.

The knowledge base is represented using Prolog facts and rules.
Facts are represented as assertions of the form "predicate(argument1, argument2, ...)".
Rules are represented as implications of the form "head :- body".

The program uses a backward-chaining inference engine to diagnose diseases.
The inference engine starts with the goal of diagnosing a disease and then tries to prove the goal by matching the goal against the facts and rules in the knowledge base.
If the inference engine succeeds in proving the goal, then the program prints the diagnosis.

The main loop of the program prompts the user to enter their symptoms, reads the symptoms from the user, and then calls the diagnose/1 predicate to diagnose the disease.

The diagnose/1 predicate uses the inference engine to diagnose a disease.
The predicate takes a list of symptoms as input and prints the diagnosis.

The read_line_to_codes/2 predicate reads a line of input from the user and converts it to a list of character codes.
