Certainly! Here's a complex and differentiated Prolog code that implements a constraint satisfaction problem known as the "Dining Philosophers Problem." This problem represents a scenario where a group of philosophers sit around a circular table with a bowl of spaghetti in front of each philosopher. There are forks placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers, and each philosopher needs two forks to eat the spaghetti.

```prolog
% Dining Philosophers Problem
% The code below represents a solution to the Dining Philosophers Problem using Prolog.

% Declare the number of philosophers and forks on the table.
num_philosophers(5).

% Define the behavior of each philosopher.
philosopher_behavior(Philosopher) :-
    think(Philosopher),
    get_forks(Philosopher),
    eat(Philosopher),
    release_forks(Philosopher),
    philosopher_behavior(Philosopher).

% Define the thinking behavior of a philosopher.
think(Philosopher) :-
    write('Philosopher '), write(Philosopher), write(' is thinking.'), nl.

% Define the behavior of getting forks.
get_forks(Philosopher) :-
    num_philosophers(N),
    NextFork is (Philosopher + 1) mod N + 1,
    pick_up_fork(Philosopher, left),
    pick_up_fork(NextFork, right),
    write('Philosopher '), write(Philosopher), write(' picked up forks.'), nl, nl.

% Define the eating behavior of a philosopher.
eat(Philosopher) :-
    write('Philosopher '), write(Philosopher), write(' is eating.'), nl.

% Define the behavior of releasing forks.
release_forks(Philosopher) :-
    num_philosophers(N),
    NextFork is (Philosopher + 1) mod N + 1,
    put_down_fork(Philosopher, left),
    put_down_fork(NextFork, right),
    write('Philosopher '), write(Philosopher), write(' released forks.'), nl, nl.

% Define the behavior of picking up a fork.
pick_up_fork(Philosopher, Fork) :-
    format('Philosopher ~w picked up ~w fork.~n', [Philosopher, Fork]).

% Define the behavior of putting down a fork.
put_down_fork(Philosopher, Fork) :-
    format('Philosopher ~w put down ~w fork.~n', [Philosopher, Fork]).

% Start the dining philosophers scenario.
start :-
    num_philosophers(N),
    forall(between(1, N, Philosopher), philosopher_behavior(Philosopher)).
```

Explanation:
- The code starts by declaring the number of philosophers using `num_philosophers/1`. In this case, there are 5 philosophers sitting around the table.
- The behavior of each philosopher is defined using `philosopher_behavior/1`. This predicate represents the main loop of each philosopher, where they think, get forks, eat, release forks, and repeat this process indefinitely.
- The thinking behavior of a philosopher is defined using `think/1`. It simply prints a message indicating that the philosopher is thinking.
- The behavior of getting forks is defined using `get_forks/1`. It calculates the index of the next philosopher, picks up the left fork, picks up the right fork (from the next philosopher), and prints a message indicating that the philosopher has picked up the forks.
- The eating behavior of a philosopher is defined using `eat/1`. It simply prints a message indicating that the philosopher is eating.
- The behavior of releasing forks is defined using `release_forks/1`. It calculates the index of the next philosopher, puts down the left fork, puts down the right fork (from the next philosopher), and prints a message indicating that the philosopher has released the forks.
- The behavior of picking up a fork is defined using `pick_up_fork/2`. It simply prints a message indicating that a philosopher has picked up a specific fork.
- The behavior of putting down a fork is defined using `put_down_fork/2`. It simply prints a message indicating that a philosopher has put down a specific fork.
- Finally, the `start/0` predicate is defined to initiate the dining philosophers scenario. It uses `forall/2` to execute `philosopher_behavior/1` for each philosopher.

To run the code, simply call `start.` in your Prolog interpreter. You will see the philosophers in action, thinking, picking up forks, eating, and releasing forks in an infinite loop.
