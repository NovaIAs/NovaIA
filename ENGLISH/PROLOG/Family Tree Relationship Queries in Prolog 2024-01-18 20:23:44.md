This code implements a family tree using Prolog, and it can determine if two people are related, and what type of relationship they have. Here's an explanation of the code:

1. **Family Tree Representation**:
   - The `family_tree/2` predicate is used to represent the family tree. The first argument is the name of the person, and the second argument is a list of their children.

2. **Ancestor/Descendant**:
   - The `ancestor/2` predicate checks if one person is an ancestor of another by recursively following the family tree.
   - The `descendant/2` predicate checks if one person is a descendant of another similarly.

3. **Sibling/Cousin**:
   - The `sibling/2` predicate checks if two people are siblings by seeing if they share a common parent.
   - The `cousin/2` predicate checks if two people are cousins by checking if they have a common grandparent.

4. **Related**:
   - The `related/2` predicate checks if two people are related by calling the `ancestor/2`, `descendant/2`, `sibling/2`, and `cousin/2` predicates.

5. **Example Queries**:
   - A series of example queries are provided to demonstrate how to use the predicates to determine if two people are related.

This code can be used to represent complex family relationships and answer various queries about them.
