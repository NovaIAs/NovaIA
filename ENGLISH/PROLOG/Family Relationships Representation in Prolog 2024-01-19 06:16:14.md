Explanation:

The code defines a set of rules for representing various family relationships in Prolog. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `parent_of`: This rule defines the parent-child relationship. For example, `parent_of(alice, bob)` means that "Alice" is the parent of "Bob."

2. `grandparent_of`: This rule defines the grandparent-grandchild relationship. It's derived from the `parent_of` rule using logical implication.

3. `sibling`: This rule defines the sibling relationship between two individuals who share the same parents.

4. `cousin`: This rule defines the cousin relationship between two individuals who share a grandparent.

5. `aunt_or_uncle`: This rule defines the aunt/uncle relationship between two individuals who are siblings with one parent.

6. `niece_or_nephew`: This rule defines the niece/nephew relationship between two individuals who are children of siblings.

7. `brother_or_sister_in_law`: This rule defines the brother-in-law/sister-in-law relationship between two individuals who are siblings of spouses.

8. `grandparent_in_law`: This rule defines the grandparent-in-law relationship between an individual and the spouse's parent.

9. `cousin_in_law`: This rule defines the cousin-in-law relationship between two individuals who are cousins of spouses.

10. `aunt_or_uncle_in_law`: This rule defines the aunt/uncle-in-law relationship between an individual and the spouse's sibling.

11. `niece_or_nephew_in_law`: This rule defines the niece/nephew-in-law relationship between an individual and the spouse's niece or nephew.

12. `brother_or_sister_in_law_in_law`: This rule defines the brother-in-law/sister-in-law-in-law relationship between an individual and the spouse's sibling's spouse.

13. `grandparent_in_law_in_law`: This rule defines the grandparent-in-law-in-law relationship between an individual and the spouse's grandparent-in-law.

14. `cousin_in_law_in_law`: This rule defines the cousin-in-law-in-law relationship between an individual and the spouse's cousin-in-law.

15. `aunt_or_uncle_in_law_in_law`: This rule defines the aunt/uncle-in-law-in-law relationship between an individual and the spouse's aunt/uncle-in-law.

16. `niece_or_nephew_in_law_in_law`: This rule defines the niece/nephew-in-law-in-law relationship between an individual and the spouse's niece/nephew-in-law.

17. `brother_or_sister_in_law_in_law_in_law`: This rule defines the brother-in-law/sister-in-law-in-law-in-law relationship between an individual and the spouse's sibling's spouse's spouse.

This set of rules provides a comprehensive representation of various family relationships in Prolog. You can use these rules to perform queries and derive information about family members based on the relationships defined in the knowledge base.
