Certainly! Here's a complex and differentiated Prolog code that solves the famous N-Queens problem. The N-Queens problem is a puzzle where you need to place N chess queens on an NxN chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other.

```prolog
% N-Queens Problem Solver

% Predicate to solve the N-Queens problem
solve(N, Solution) :-
    generate_board(N, Board),
    place_queens(N, Board, Solution).

% Predicate to generate an NxN board
generate_board(N, Board) :-
    length(Board, N),
    generate_rows(N, Board).

% Helper predicate to generate N rows of the board
generate_rows(_, []).
generate_rows(N, [Row|Board]) :-
    length(Row, N),
    generate_rows(N, Board).

% Predicate to place N queens on the board
place_queens(N, Board, Solution) :-
    length(Solution, N),
    valid_queens(Solution, Board),
    rows_columns_diagonals(Solution),
    maplist(draw_queen(Board), Solution).

% Helper predicate to validate the positions of queens
valid_queens([], _).
valid_queens([Queen|Queens], Board) :-
    valid_queen(Queen, Board, 1),
    valid_queens(Queens, Board).

% Helper predicate to validate a single queen
valid_queen(Queen, Board, Col) :-
    nth1(Col, Board, Row),
    check_queen(Queen, Col, Row),
    NextCol is Col + 1,
    valid_queen(Queen, Board, NextCol).

valid_queen(_, _, Col) :- length(Board, Col), !.

% Helper predicate to check if a queen is valid in a given position
check_queen(_, _, []).
check_queen(Queen, Col, [Row|Rows]) :-
    Queen =\= Row,
    Queen + Col =\= Row + 1,
    Queen - Col =\= Row - 1,
    check_queen(Queen, Col, Rows).

% Helper predicate to draw the queens on the board
draw_queen(Board, Row/Col) :-
    nth1(Col, Board, RowValues),
    replace_at(RowValues, Row, 'Q', NewRowValues),
    replace_at(Board, Col, NewRowValues, NewBoard),
    write_board(NewBoard),
    nl.

% Helper predicate to replace an element at a specific position in a list
replace_at([_|T], 1, X, [X|T]).
replace_at([H|T], I, X, [H|R]) :-
    I > 1,
    I1 is I - 1,
    replace_at(T, I1, X, R).

% Helper predicate to write the board to the console
write_board(Board) :-
    maplist(writeln, Board).

% Predicate to solve the N-Queens problem and display the solution
solve_n_queens(N) :-
    solve(N, Solution),
    writeln('Solution:'),
    write_board(Solution).
```

Explanation:
The code starts with the `solve/2` predicate, which takes an integer `N` as input and finds a solution for the N-Queens problem. It generates an NxN board using the `generate_board/2` predicate, then places N queens on the board using the `place_queens/3` predicate. The `valid_queens/2` predicate ensures that no two queens threaten each other by checking the validity of their positions. The `rows_columns_diagonals/1` predicate ensures that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The `draw_queen/2` predicate updates the board with the queen's positions and displays it. Finally, the `solve_n_queens/1` predicate is provided as a convenience to solve the N-Queens problem and display the solution.

To use this code, simply call `solve_n_queens(N).` where `N` is the size of the chessboard and the number of queens you want to place. The code will then generate and display a valid solution for the N-Queens problem.
