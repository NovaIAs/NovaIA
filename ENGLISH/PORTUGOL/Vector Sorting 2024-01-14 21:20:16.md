This code sorts a vector of integers in ascending order.

The program first defines a constant called `tamanho` which is set to 10. This constant is used to define the size of the vector.

Next, the program declares an array called `vetor` of size `tamanho`. This array will be used to store the integers to be sorted.

The program then uses a `for` loop to initialize the `vetor` array with random integers. The `random` function is used to generate a random integer between 0 and 99.

The program then uses two nested `for` loops to sort the `vetor` array in ascending order. The outer `for` loop iterates over the elements of the array from the beginning to the end, while the inner `for` loop iterates over the elements of the array from the current element to the end.

If the value of the current element in the outer `for` loop is greater than the value of the current element in the inner `for` loop, then the values of the two elements are swapped.

After the two `for` loops have finished, the `vetor` array is sorted in ascending order.

Finally, the program uses a `for` loop to print the values of the `vetor` array to the console.
