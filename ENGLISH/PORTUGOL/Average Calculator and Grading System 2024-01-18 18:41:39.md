Explanation:

The code is designed to calculate the average of 10 integer grades entered by the user. It also checks if the average is greater than or equal to 7, and prints whether the student passed or failed based on their average.

Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

- `DECLARE` section:
   - `integer n`: Integer variable used for loop counter and array index.
   - `integer sum`: Integer variable to store the sum of grades.
   - `float average`: Floating-point variable to store the average of grades.
   - `array[10] of integer grades`: Array of integers to store the 10 grades entered by the user.

- `BEGIN` section:
   - `PRINT("Enter 10 grades:");`: Prompts the user to enter 10 grades.

   - `FOR n = 1 TO 10 DO`: Starts a loop that iterates 10 times, from 1 to 10.

   - Inside the loop, `READ(grades[n]);` reads an integer value from the user and stores it in the `grades` array at index `n`.

   - `sum = 0;`: Initializes the `sum` variable to 0 before calculating the sum of grades.

   - Another `FOR` loop is used to iterate through the `grades` array and calculate the sum of all grades. The `sum` variable is updated in each iteration by adding the current grade to it.

   - `average = sum / 10;`: Calculates the average of grades by dividing the sum by 10.

   - `PRINT("The average of the 10 grades is: ", average);`: Prints the calculated average to the console.

   - `IF average >= 7 THEN`: Checks if the average is greater than or equal to 7.

   - If the average is greater than or equal to 7, it prints "The student passed." to the console.

   - If the average is less than 7, it prints "The student failed." to the console.

- `END;`: Indicates the end of the program.

This code effectively calculates the average of 10 grades and displays whether the student passed or failed based on their average, providing a simple and functional program for grade assessment.
