Certainly! Here's a complex code written in pseudocode that solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using a genetic algorithm:

```
function generatePopulation(cityList):
    population = []
    for i = 0 to populationSize:
        chromosome = randomlyPermute(cityList)
        population.append(chromosome)
    return population

function calculateFitness(chromosome):
    totalDistance = 0
    for i = 0 to chromosome.length - 1:
        currentCity = chromosome[i]
        nextCity = chromosome[(i + 1) % chromosome.length]
        distance = getDistance(currentCity, nextCity)
        totalDistance += distance
    fitness = 1 / totalDistance  // Inverse of total distance
    return fitness

function selection(population):
    selectedPopulation = []
    totalFitness = sum(fitness for chromosome in population)
    for i = 0 to populationSize:
        rand = random(0, totalFitness)
        cumulativeFitness = 0
        for chromosome in population:
            cumulativeFitness += chromosome.fitness
            if cumulativeFitness >= rand:
                selectedPopulation.append(chromosome)
                break
    return selectedPopulation

function crossover(parent1, parent2):
    child1 = []
    child2 = []
    start = random(0, parent1.length - 1)
    end = random(start + 1, parent1.length)
    for i = start to end:
        child1.append(parent1[i])
        child2.append(parent2[i])
    for city in parent2:
        if city not in child1:
            child1.append(city)
    for city in parent1:
        if city not in child2:
            child2.append(city)
    return child1, child2

function mutation(chromosome):
    if random(0, 1) < mutationRate:
        index1 = random(0, chromosome.length - 1)
        index2 = random(0, chromosome.length - 1)
        swap(city1, city2)  // Swap two cities in the chromosome

function geneticAlgorithm(cityList, populationSize, mutationRate, generations):
    population = generatePopulation(cityList)
    for generation = 1 to generations:
        for chromosome in population:
            chromosome.fitness = calculateFitness(chromosome)
        selectedPopulation = selection(population)
        newPopulation = []
        while newPopulation.length < populationSize:
            parent1 = randomChoice(selectedPopulation)
            parent2 = randomChoice(selectedPopulation)
            child1, child2 = crossover(parent1, parent2)
            mutation(child1)
            mutation(child2)
            newPopulation.append(child1)
            newPopulation.append(child2)
        population = newPopulation
    bestChromosome = getBestChromosome(population)
    return bestChromosome
```

Explanation:
1. The `generatePopulation` function creates an initial population with randomly permuted city lists.
2. The `calculateFitness` function calculates the fitness of a chromosome by summing the distances between cities.
3. The `selection` function performs fitness-proportionate selection to choose parents for crossover.
4. The `crossover` function performs a two-point crossover to generate children from parents.
5. The `mutation` function randomly swaps two cities in a chromosome with a probability of `mutationRate`.
6. The `geneticAlgorithm` function orchestrates the evolutionary process by repeatedly evaluating fitness, selecting parents, applying crossover and mutation, and updating the population.
7. The algorithm terminates after the specified number of generations and returns the best chromosome found.
