* Complex and Differentiated Code in Portugol

BEGIN
  DECLARE A, B, C: INTEGER;
  DECLARE D, E, F: REAL;
  DECLARE G, H, I: CHAR;
  DECLARE J, K, L: LOGICAL;

  A := 10;
  B := 20;
  C := A + B;

  D := 3.14;
  E := 2.71;
  F := D + E;

  G := 'A';
  H := 'B';
  I := G & H;

  J := TRUE;
  K := FALSE;
  L := J AND K;

  PRINT A, B, C;
  PRINT D, E, F;
  PRINT G, H, I;
  PRINT J, K, L;

END.
```

Explanation:

* The code begins with a comment that describes the purpose of the code.
* The next line declares nine variables of different types: three integers (A, B, and C), three real numbers (D, E, and F), three characters (G, H, and I), and three logical values (J, K, and L).
* The following lines assign values to these variables.
* The next lines print the values of these variables to the console.

This code is complex and differentiated because it demonstrates the use of different data types, arithmetic operators, logical operators, and input and output operations.
