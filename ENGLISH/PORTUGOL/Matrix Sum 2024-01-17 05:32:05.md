This code is a program that sums two 10x10 matrices and prints the result.
The program first declares the type `matriz` as an array of 10 rows and 10 columns of integers.
Then it declares three variables of type `matriz`: `m1`, `m2`, and `m3`.
The variables `m1` and `m2` are used to store the two input matrices, and the variable `m3` is used to store the sum of the two input matrices.
The program then uses two nested loops to read the values of the two input matrices from the user.
After the input matrices have been read, the program uses another two nested loops to sum the values of the two input matrices and store the result in the variable `m3`.
Finally, the program uses another two nested loops to print the values of the variable `m3` to the console.
