This code is a nested loop that prints all possible combinations of 18 integers from 1 to 100. The code is very complex and has a total of 18 nested loops. The code is also very long and has a total of 2,187 lines of code.

Here is a brief explanation of the code:

* The code first defines 18 integer variables, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, and z.
* The code then enters a nested loop that iterates through all possible combinations of values for the 18 variables.
* The code uses a write statement to print the values of the 18 variables.
* The code then uses a readln statement to wait for the user to press enter before continuing.

This code is a very complex example of a nested loop. The code is not very useful, but it is a good example of how complex nested loops can be.
