Explanation:

This code generates a pyramid of numbers from 1 to n, where n is a positive integer.

The variable n is initialized to 10, which means that the pyramid will have 10 rows.

The variable c is initialized to 1, which is the value of the first number in the pyramid.

The variables i and j are used to iterate through the rows and columns of the pyramid.

The outer while loop iterates through the rows of the pyramid.

The inner while loop iterates through the columns of the pyramid.

The if statement checks if the current column is less than or equal to the current row. If it is, then the value of c is printed. Otherwise, a space is printed.

The value of j is then incremented by 1.

The value of c is then incremented by 1.

The value of j is then reset to 1.

The value of i is then incremented by 1.

The outer while loop then repeats until all of the rows of the pyramid have been printed.
