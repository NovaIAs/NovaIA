**Explanation:**

* This code generates a fractal image using the Chaos Game method.
* The Chaos Game method is a simple algorithm that produces complex and interesting patterns. It works by repeatedly choosing a random vertex of a triangle and then moving the current point halfway between the current point and the chosen vertex.
* The code first creates a new image and sets the background color to white.
* It then defines the three vertices of the triangle.
* It generates a random starting point within the triangle.
* It then iterates the chaos game algorithm $maxIterations times.
* For each iteration, it chooses a random vertex, calculates the midpoint between the current point and the chosen vertex, sets the pixel at the midpoint to black, and updates the current point.
* Finally, the code saves the image to a file and displays it using Tk.
