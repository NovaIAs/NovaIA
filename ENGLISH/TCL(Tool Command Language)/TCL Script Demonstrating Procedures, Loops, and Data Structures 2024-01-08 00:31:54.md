Explanation:

* The first part of the code defines a procedure called `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a number.
* The second part of the code creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10 and uses a `foreach` loop to iterate over the list. For each number, it calls the `factorial` procedure to calculate the factorial and then prints the number and its factorial.
* The third part of the code creates a dictionary to store the names and ages of people. It then adds some people to the dictionary and uses a `foreach` loop to iterate over the dictionary. For each person, it gets the age from the dictionary and then prints the person's name and age.
* The fourth part of the code creates a list of lists to represent a two-dimensional array. It then uses a `foreach` loop to iterate over the array and prints each element of the array.
