```tcl
# This Tcl script is a complex and differentiated code that generates a fractal image using the Chaos Game method.

# Load the required libraries
package require Tcl 8.5
package require Img

# Define the initial parameters
set canvasWidth 512
set canvasHeight 512
set iterations 1000000
set points 3

# Create a new image
set img [Img::Create canvasWidth canvasHeight -format RGB]

# Generate the fractal image
for {set i 0} {$i < $iterations} {incr i} {
    # Choose a random starting point
    set x [rand $canvasWidth]
    set y [rand $canvasHeight]

    # Iterate the chosen point
    for {set j 0} {$j < $points} {incr j} {
        # Choose a random point from the initial set of points
        set point [lindex $points $j]

        # Calculate the midpoint between the chosen point and the current point
        set x [expr {$x + [lindex $point 0] / 2.0}]
        set y [expr {$y + [lindex $point 1] / 2.0}]

        # Plot the point on the image
        [Img::PutPixel $img $x $y -color {white}]
    }
}

# Save the image to a file
[Img::WritePNG $img "fractal.png"]

```

Explanation:

1. **Loading the Required Libraries**: The first step is to load the required Tcl libraries. In this case, we use the Img library for image creation and manipulation.

2. **Defining the Initial Parameters**: Next, we define the initial parameters for generating the fractal image. These parameters include the canvas size (width and height), the number of iterations, and the number of points in the initial set.

3. **Creating a New Image**: We create a new image using the Img library. The image has the specified canvas size and is in RGB format.

4. **Generating the Fractal Image**: The core of the script is a loop that iterates a specified number of times. In each iteration, a random starting point is chosen on the canvas. This starting point is then iterated multiple times, using the Chaos Game method. During each iteration, a random point from the initial set of points is chosen, and the current point is moved towards the chosen point by a certain fraction. The resulting point is then plotted on the image.

5. **Saving the Image to a File**: Once all the iterations are complete, the generated fractal image is saved to a PNG file using the Img library.

This script demonstrates a complex and differentiated use of Tcl, involving image generation, random number generation, iteration, and file I/O. It also showcases the power of Tcl in creating intricate patterns and images through a few lines of code.
