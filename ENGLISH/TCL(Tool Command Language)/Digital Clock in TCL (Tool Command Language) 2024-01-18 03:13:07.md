This code creates a simple graphical user interface (GUI) in TCL that displays the current time and allows the user to start and stop a clock. The GUI consists of a window with a frame that contains a label to display the current time and two buttons to start and stop the clock.

The `wm title` command sets the title of the window to "TCL Code".

The `frame` command creates a new frame to hold the controls. The `-width`, `-height`, `-relief`, and `-borderwidth` options specify the size, relief, and border width of the frame.

The `label` command creates a new label to display the current time. The `-text` option specifies the text to display on the label.

The `button` command creates two new buttons to start and stop the clock. The `-text` option specifies the text to display on the buttons and the `-command` option specifies the command to execute when the button is clicked.

The `pack` command packs the controls frame into the window.

The `wm geometry` command sets the size and position of the window.

The `mainloop` command starts the main event loop, which waits for user input and processes events.

When the user clicks the "Start Clock" button, the `clock event` command schedules a periodic event that updates the time label every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).

When the user clicks the "Stop Clock" button, the `clock delete` command deletes the periodic event, which stops the clock.
