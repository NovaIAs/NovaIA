# Purpose: Demonstrates advanced Tcl programming techniques using recursion, dynamic code generation, and object-oriented programming.

# Define a custom command to handle recursive file operations
proc walkdir {dirname scriptname} {
    # Check if the directory exists
    if {[file exists $dirname]} {
        # Get a list of all files and subdirectories in the directory
        set files [glob -nocomplain -directory $dirname *]

        # Process each file or subdirectory
        foreach file $files {
            # Check if the file is a directory
            if {[file isdirectory $file]} {
                # Call the walkdir command recursively on the subdirectory
                uplevel [list walkdir $file $scriptname]
            } else {
                # Execute the script on the file
                uplevel [list $scriptname $file]
            }
        }
    }
}

# Define a custom command to generate dynamic Tcl code
proc genCode {varname value} {
    # Create a string containing the Tcl code to set the variable
    set code [format "set %s %s" $varname $value]

    # Compile and execute the generated code
    uplevel 1 [eval $code]
}

# Define a custom class to represent a person
class Person {
    # Initialize the class with a name and age
    constructor {name age} {
        set self {name $name age $age}
    }

    # Define a method to get the person's name
    method getName {} {
        return [lindex $self name]
    }

    # Define a method to get the person's age
    method getAge {} {
        return [lindex $self age]
    }

    # Define a method to greet the person
    method greet {} {
        puts [format "Hello, my name is %s and I am %d years old." [self getName] [self getAge]]
    }
}

# Create a new instance of the Person class
set person [Person "John Doe" 25]

# Execute the recursive file operation command
walkdir "/path/to/directory" {
    # Generate dynamic Tcl code to count the number of lines in the file
    genCode numLines [expr {[llength [split [read $file]]]}]

    # Print the number of lines in the file
    puts [format "File %s has %d lines." $file $numLines]
}

# Call the greet method on the Person object
[Person greet]
```

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Custom Command for Recursive File Operations**: The `walkdir` command is defined to handle recursive file operations. It takes two arguments: `dirname`, which is the directory to process, and `scriptname`, which is a Tcl script to execute on each file or subdirectory.

2. **Dynamic Code Generation**: The `genCode` command is defined to generate dynamic Tcl code. It takes two arguments: `varname`, which is the name of the variable to set, and `value`, which is the value to assign to the variable.

3. **Custom Class for Person Objects**: The `Person` class is defined using the `class` command. It has a constructor method to initialize the object with a name and age, and methods to get the person's name, age, and greet the person.

4. **Recursive File Operation Execution**: The `walkdir` command is called with the directory to process and a script that generates dynamic code to count the number of lines in each file. The number of lines is then printed.

5. **Method Invocation on Person Object**: The `greet` method of the `person` object is called to greet the person.
