```

This code generates a list of all possible combinations of colors and shapes, and then prints out the name of each figure along with its color and shape.

The `makeFigure` procedure takes two arguments: a color and a shape. It creates a dictionary with two entries: `color` and `shape`. The `printFigure` procedure takes one argument: a figure. It prints out the name of the figure along with its color and shape.

The `main` procedure calls the `makeFigure` and `printFigure` procedures to generate and print out the list of all possible figures.

Here is an example of the output of the code:

```
Figure: circle(color)
Shape: circle(shape)
Figure: square(color)
Shape: square(shape)
Figure: triangle(color)
Shape: triangle(shape)
Figure: rectangle(color)
Shape: rectangle(shape)
Figure: pentagon(color)
Shape: pentagon(shape)
Figure: hexagon(color)
Shape: hexagon(shape)
