```tcl
# This is a complex TCL script that performs a variety of tasks.

# First, we define some variables.

set my_string "Hello, world!"
set my_list {one two three four five}
set my_dict [dict create {key1 value1 key2 value2 key3 value3}]

# Next, we use the "foreach" command to iterate over the elements of the list.

foreach item $my_list {
    puts $item
}

# We can also use the "for" command to iterate over a range of values.

for {set i 0} {$i < 10} {incr i} {
    puts $i
}

# The "while" command can be used to execute a block of code while a condition is true.

set i 0
while {$i < 10} {
    puts $i
    incr i
}

# The "if" command can be used to conditionally execute a block of code.

if {$my_string == "Hello, world!"} {
    puts "The string is equal to 'Hello, world!'"
} else {
    puts "The string is not equal to 'Hello, world!'"
}

# The "switch" command can be used to execute different blocks of code depending on the value of a variable.

switch -glob $my_string {
    "Hello, world!" {
        puts "The string is equal to 'Hello, world!'"
    }
    "*world*" {
        puts "The string contains the word 'world'"
    }
    default {
        puts "The string does not match any of the patterns"
    }
}

# The "proc" command can be used to define new commands.

proc my_proc {args} {
    puts "This is my procedure"
    puts "The arguments are: $args"
}

my_proc one two three

# The "package" command can be used to create and manage packages.

package require Tcl 8.5
package require Tk 8.5

# The "namespace" command can be used to create and manage namespaces.

namespace eval ::my_namespace {
    variable my_variable "Hello, world!"
    command my_command {
        puts "This is my command"
    }
}

::my_namespace::my_command

# The "interp" command can be used to create and manage interpreters.

interp create my_interp
interp eval my_interp {
    puts "This is my interpreter"
}

interp delete my_interp

# The "exit" command can be used to exit the current interpreter.

exit
```

This code performs a variety of tasks, including:

* Iterating over a list and printing each element
* Iterating over a range of values and printing each value
* Executing a block of code while a condition is true
* Conditionally executing a block of code
* Executing different blocks of code depending on the value of a variable
* Defining new commands
* Creating and managing packages
* Creating and managing namespaces
* Creating and managing interpreters
* Exiting the current interpreter

This code is complex and demonstrates a variety of advanced TCL features. It is not intended for beginners.
