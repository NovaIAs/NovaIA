```tcl
# Welcome to the world of complex and differentiated TCL code!

# Let's start by defining some colors and creating a canvas to draw on.

set colors {red green blue yellow orange purple black white}
canvas .c -width 600 -height 600 -background white

# We'll use a loop to draw a series of concentric circles.

for {set radius 50} {$radius <= 300} {incr radius 50} {
    # Choose a random color for this circle.

    set color [lindex $colors [expr {int(rand() * [llength $colors])}]]

    # Draw the circle.

    .c create oval -$radius -$radius $radius $radius -fill $color
}

# Now, let's add some text to the canvas.

.c create text 300 300 -text "Hello, TCL!" -font Arial 24 bold

# And finally, we'll create a button that, when clicked, will change the background color of the canvas.

button .b -text "Change Background Color" -command {.c configure -background [lindex $colors [expr {int(rand() * [llength $colors])}]]}

# And there you have it! A complex and differentiated TCL code that draws concentric circles, displays text, and changes the background color of the canvas when a button is clicked.

# Feel free to experiment with the code and make it even more complex and differentiated!
```

**Explanation:**

* The code starts by defining an array of colors and creating a canvas widget with a white background.
* A `for` loop is used to draw a series of concentric circles. The radius of each circle is increased by 50 pixels in each iteration of the loop.
* A random color is chosen for each circle using the `rand()` and `lindex()` commands.
* The `create oval` command is used to draw each circle.
* The code then uses the `create text` command to add some text to the canvas.
* Finally, a button widget is created using the `button` command. When the button is clicked, the `command` option causes the background color of the canvas to be changed to a random color.

This code is complex and differentiated because it uses a variety of TCL commands and techniques, including loops, arrays, random number generation, and event handling. It also creates a visually appealing and interactive program.
