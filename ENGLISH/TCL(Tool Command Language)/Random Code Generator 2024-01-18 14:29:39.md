Explanation:

* The generate_code procedure is defined, which takes no arguments and returns a string containing the generated code.
* Inside the generate_code procedure, the following steps are performed:
    * The code, indent, and level variables are initialized.
    * A for loop is used to generate 100 expressions.
    * For each expression, the following steps are performed:
        * A random number is generated and assigned to the num variable.
        * A random operator is generated and assigned to the op variable.
        * A random variable name is generated and assigned to the var variable.
        * An expression is generated using the num, op, and var variables, and is assigned to the expr variable.
        * The expression is added to the code string.
        * The indentation level is incremented.
        * A random number of nested blocks is generated.
        * For each nested block, the following steps are performed:
            * A random block type is generated.
            * If the block type is 0, an if block is generated.
            * If the block type is 1, a for block is generated.
            * A random number of statements is generated for the block.
            * The statements are added to the code string.
            * The indentation level is decremented.
        * The indentation level is decremented.
* The generated code is returned.
* The generated code is printed to the console.

This code generates a complex and differentiated code that is unlikely to be repeated again. The code includes a variety of expressions, statements, and blocks, and is indented in a consistent manner.
