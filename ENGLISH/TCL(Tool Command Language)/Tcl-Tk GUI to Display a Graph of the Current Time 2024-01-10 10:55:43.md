This code creates a simple graphical user interface (GUI) in Tcl/Tk that displays a graph of the current time. The GUI has three buttons: "Start", "Stop", and "Reset". The "Start" button starts a timer that updates the current time every second. The "Stop" button stops the timer. The "Reset" button resets the timer and clears the graph.

The code uses the `canvas` widget to display the graph. The `canvas` widget is a powerful drawing tool that can be used to create a variety of shapes and lines. In this code, the `canvas` widget is used to draw a line for each data point in the `data` list.

The `update_graph` procedure is called whenever the data list is updated. This procedure clears the canvas and then draws a line for each data point in the list. The `update_time` procedure is called every second by the timer. This procedure increments the current time and updates the label that displays the current time. It also updates the data list and calls the `update_graph` procedure to redraw the graph.

The `mainloop` procedure starts the main event loop for the GUI. The main event loop listens for events such as button clicks and mouse movements. When an event occurs, the main event loop calls the appropriate event handler.
