This script is a complex example of TCL code that performs a disk usage analysis of a given directory and generates a report on the results. The script first prompts the user to select a directory to analyze, then uses the 'du' command to get the disk usage information for the directory. The output of the 'du' command is parsed to extract the disk usage information, which is then displayed in a report. The report includes the total disk usage of the directory, as well as the disk usage of each subdirectory. The script also includes a timestamp to indicate when the report was generated.

This script is a good example of how TCL can be used to perform complex tasks in a relatively straightforward manner. The script is also a good example of how TCL can be used to interact with the operating system, in this case by using the 'du' command.
