This code defines a complex Tcl procedure called `myComplexFunction` that takes two arguments, performs a series of calculations and checks, and returns a list of results. It also defines a helper procedure called `isPrime` to check if a given number is prime.

Here's an explanation of the code:

- The `myComplexFunction` procedure takes two arguments, `arg1` and `arg2`, and calculates a result using a complex expression involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- It then creates a list of prime numbers up to the value of the calculated result using a loop and the `isPrime` procedure.

- The `isPrime` procedure checks if a given number is prime by iteratively trying to divide the number by integers from 2 to its square root. If any of these divisions result in a remainder of 0, the number is not prime.

- The `myComplexFunction` procedure also checks if the calculated result is a perfect square by checking if the square root of the result is an integer.

- Finally, the procedure returns a list containing the calculated result, the list of prime numbers, and a flag indicating if the result is a perfect square.

The example usage of the `myComplexFunction` procedure demonstrates how to call the procedure, extract the results, and print them.

This code showcases complexity and differentiation in Tcl by performing multiple calculations, checks, and list manipulations to produce a variety of results based on the input arguments.
