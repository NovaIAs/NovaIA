Explanation:

This C++ program demonstrates a more comprehensive and complex code that involves sorting a vector of pairs, counting the frequency of elements, and sorting the pairs by their frequency.

1. It defines a comparator function `comparePairs` to sort pairs based on their second element in ascending order.

2. It creates a vector of pairs of integers and sorts it using the `sort` function and the `comparePairs` comparator.

3. It creates a map to store the frequency of each second element in the sorted vector.

4. It iterates over the sorted vector and increments the frequency of the second element in the map.

5. It creates a new vector to store the pairs with their frequency.

6. It iterates over the map and adds each pair and its frequency to the new vector.

7. It sorts the new vector by the frequency of the second element in descending order using the `sort` function and the `comparePairs` comparator.

8. Finally, it prints the pairs along with their frequency.

This code showcases more complex data structures (maps and vectors), sorting algorithms, and demonstrates how to work with pairs in C++.
