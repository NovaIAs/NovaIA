Explanation:

1. **Graph Data Structure**: We define a `Graph` struct to represent the graph. It contains an adjacency list (`adjList`) to represent the edges, a map to keep track of visited nodes (`visited`), and a map to store the distance from the starting node (`distance`).

2. **addEdge Function**: This function adds an edge between two nodes in the graph. It updates the adjacency list accordingly.

3. **BFS Function**: This function performs breadth-first search (BFS) traversal starting from a given node. It marks nodes as visited, calculates their distance from the starting node, and enqueues unvisited neighbors for further exploration.

4. **printShortestPath Function**: This function takes two nodes as input and prints the shortest path between them. It first performs BFS from the starting node to calculate the distance to all other nodes. Then, it backtracks from the end node to construct the shortest path.

5. **Main Function**: In the `main` function, we create a `Graph` object, add edges to the graph, and perform BFS starting from node "A". Finally, we print the shortest path from "A" to "K".

This code demonstrates a complex and differentiated C++ program that performs breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph to find the shortest path between two nodes. It includes a custom data structure to represent the graph and functions to add edges, perform BFS, and print the shortest path. The code is well-commented and organized, making it easy to understand and modify.
