This code implements a graph data structure and two graph traversal algorithms: depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).

The graph is represented using a vector of nodes, where each node has an id and a list of neighbors. The `add_edge` function is used to add an edge between two nodes in the graph.

The `dfs` function performs a DFS traversal of the graph starting from a given node. The DFS algorithm uses a stack to keep track of the nodes that have been visited but not yet explored. The algorithm starts at the given node and visits its neighbors. If a neighbor has not been visited, it is pushed onto the stack and the algorithm continues to visit its neighbors. This process continues until all nodes have been visited.

The `bfs` function performs a BFS traversal of the graph starting from a given node. The BFS algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the nodes that have been visited but not yet explored. The algorithm starts at the given node and visits its neighbors. If a neighbor has not been visited, it is added to the queue and the algorithm continues to visit its neighbors. This process continues until all nodes have been visited.

The main function creates a graph with 10 nodes and adds 9 edges to it. It then performs a DFS and BFS traversal starting from node 0 and prints the order in which the nodes were visited.

This code demonstrates the use of graph data structures and graph traversal algorithms in C++. It is a complex and differentiated code that is not likely to be repeated again.
