Explanation:

This C++ program takes a vector of integers as input and performs various operations on it:

1. It creates a map to store the frequency of each number in the vector.

2. It creates a set to store the unique numbers in the vector.

3. It sorts the unique numbers in ascending order.

4. It creates a vector of pairs to store the numbers and their frequencies.

5. It sorts the vector of pairs by the frequency of the numbers in descending order.

6. Finally, it prints the numbers and their frequencies in descending order of frequency.

The output of the program will be a list of the unique numbers in the vector along with their frequencies, sorted in descending order of frequency.
