This code implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers up to a given limit.
The algorithm works by iteratively marking off multiples of each prime number, starting with 2.
When a number is marked off, it is not considered for further marking, and any remaining unmarked numbers are prime.

The code first defines a function called sieve_of_eratosthenes that takes a limit as input and returns a vector of prime numbers up to that limit.
The function initializes a vector of booleans to represent whether each number is prime or not, marking off 0 and 1 as non-prime.

The function then iterates over all numbers from 2 to the limit.
If a number is prime, it is added to the vector of primes, and all multiples of the number are marked off as non-prime.

Once the function has iterated over all numbers up to the limit, it returns the vector of prime numbers.

The main function of the program calls the sieve_of_eratosthenes function to generate all prime numbers up to 100 and then prints the prime numbers to the console.
