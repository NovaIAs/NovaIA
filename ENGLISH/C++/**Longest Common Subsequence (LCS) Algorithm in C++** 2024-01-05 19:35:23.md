**Explanation:**

This code implements a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. The LCS problem is to find the longest sequence of characters that is common to two strings.

The code first creates a table to store the lengths of the LCS of the prefixes of the two strings. The table is filled in bottom-up manner, starting from the bottom-left corner and working its way up to the top-right corner.

At each step, the algorithm compares the last characters of the two strings. If they are the same, then the LCS of the two strings is one character longer than the LCS of the two strings without the last character. Otherwise, the LCS of the two strings is the maximum of the LCS of the two strings without the last character of the first string and the LCS of the two strings without the last character of the second string.

Once the table is filled, the algorithm returns the length of the LCS of the two strings, which is the value in the top-right corner of the table.

The algorithm then prints the LCS of the two strings. To do this, it starts at the top-right corner of the table and works its way down to the bottom-left corner. At each step, the algorithm checks if the value in the table is equal to the length of the LCS. If it is, then the character at the corresponding position in the first string is part of the LCS. The algorithm prints this character and then continues to the next step.

The algorithm terminates when it reaches the bottom-left corner of the table. At this point, the entire LCS of the two strings has been printed.
