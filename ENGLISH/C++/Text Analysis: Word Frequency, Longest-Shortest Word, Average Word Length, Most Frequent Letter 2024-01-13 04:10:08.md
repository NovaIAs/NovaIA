Explanation:

This C++ program performs various text analysis tasks on a given input text. It includes:

- **Word Frequency Analysis**: It calculates the frequency of each word in the text and identifies the top 10 most frequently used words.

- **Longest and Shortest Word Identification**: It finds the longest and shortest words in the text.

- **Average Word Length Calculation**: It computes the average length of words in the text.

- **Most Frequently Used Letter Identification**: It determines the letter that appears most frequently in the text.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Input Text Processing**:
   - The program reads the input text from the standard input.
   - It tokenizes the text into individual words using a stringstream.

2. **Word Frequency Counting**:
   - For each word in the tokenized text, the program increments its frequency in a map.

3. **Sorting Word Frequencies**:
   - The map of word frequencies is sorted in descending order using a custom comparator function.

4. **Top 10 Most Frequently Used Words**:
   - The top 10 words with the highest frequencies are identified and stored in a vector.

5. **Longest and Shortest Word Identification**:
   - The program iterates through the tokenized words to find the longest and shortest words.

6. **Average Word Length Calculation**:
   - It calculates the total length of all words and divides it by the number of words to get the average word length.

7. **Letter Frequency Counting**:
   - The program counts the frequency of each letter in the tokenized words and stores it in a map.

8. **Sorting Letter Frequencies**:
   - The map of letter frequencies is sorted in descending order using the same custom comparator function.

9. **Most Frequently Used Letter Identification**:
   - The first letter in the sorted map represents the most frequently used letter.

10. **Output**:
    - The program prints the top 10 most frequently used words, the longest and shortest words, the average word length, and the most frequently used letter.
