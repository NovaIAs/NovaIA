```python
# This Python code defines a function called "fractal_tree" that generates a fractal tree pattern.

# The function takes four parameters:
# 1. "turtle": A turtle object that will be used to draw the tree.
# 2. "length": The initial length of the trunk of the tree.
# 3. "angle": The angle at which the branches of the tree will be drawn.
# 4. "depth": The number of levels of recursion to use when drawing the tree.

def fractal_tree(turtle, length, angle, depth):
  
    # If the depth is 0, then we have reached the base case and we should stop drawing the tree.
    if depth == 0:
        return

    # Draw the trunk of the tree.
    turtle.forward(length)

    # Turn the turtle to the left by the specified angle.
    turtle.left(angle)

    # Recursively draw the left branch of the tree.
    fractal_tree(turtle, length * 0.75, angle, depth - 1)

    # Turn the turtle to the right by twice the specified angle.
    turtle.right(2 * angle)

    # Recursively draw the right branch of the tree.
    fractal_tree(turtle, length * 0.75, angle, depth - 1)

    # Turn the turtle back to its original orientation.
    turtle.left(angle)

    # Move the turtle back to the starting position.
    turtle.backward(length)


# Create a turtle object.
turtle = turtle.Turtle()

# Set the turtle's speed to the fastest setting.
turtle.speed(0)

# Set the turtle's pen color to green.
turtle.pencolor("green")

# Set the turtle's pen size to 1.
turtle.pensize(1)

# Set the initial length of the trunk of the tree.
length = 100

# Set the angle at which the branches of the tree will be drawn.
angle = 45

# Set the number of levels of recursion to use when drawing the tree.
depth = 10

# Call the "fractal_tree" function to draw the tree.
fractal_tree(turtle, length, angle, depth)

# Keep the turtle window open until the user clicks on it.
turtle.done()

Explanation:

1. The `fractal_tree` function takes four parameters: `turtle`, `length`, `angle`, and `depth`.
2. The function starts by checking if the `depth` parameter is equal to 0. If it is, then the function returns, which means that we have reached the base case and we should stop drawing the tree.
3. If the `depth` parameter is not equal to 0, then the function proceeds to draw the trunk of the tree by moving the turtle forward by the specified `length`.
4. After drawing the trunk, the function turns the turtle to the left by the specified `angle`.
5. The function then recursively calls itself to draw the left branch of the tree. The `length` parameter is multiplied by 0.75 to make the left branch shorter than the trunk.
6. After drawing the left branch, the function turns the turtle to the right by twice the specified `angle`.
7. The function then recursively calls itself to draw the right branch of the tree. The `length` parameter is again multiplied by 0.75 to make the right branch shorter than the trunk.
8. After drawing the right branch, the function turns the turtle back to its original orientation.
9. Finally, the function moves the turtle back to the starting position by moving it backward by the specified `length`.
10. The main part of the code creates a turtle object, sets its speed, pen color, and pen size, and then calls the `fractal_tree` function to draw the tree.
11. The `turtle.done()` function is called at the end to keep the turtle window open until the user clicks on it.
