Certainly! Below is a complex and differentiated Python code that implements a genetic algorithm to solve the famous "Travelling Salesman Problem" (TSP). This problem involves finding the shortest possible route that allows a traveling salesman to visit a set of cities and return to the starting point, without visiting any city more than once.

```python
import random

class City:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def distance_to(self, city):
        return ((self.x - city.x) ** 2 + (self.y - city.y) ** 2) ** 0.5

class TravelingSalesman:
    def __init__(self, cities):
        self.cities = cities
        self.num_cities = len(cities)
        self.population_size = 100
        self.elite_size = 20
        self.mutation_rate = 0.01

    def generate_initial_population(self):
        return [random.sample(self.cities, self.num_cities) for _ in range(self.population_size)]

    def calculate_fitness(self, route):
        total_distance = sum(city.distance_to(route[i + 1]) for i, city in enumerate(route[:-1]))
        return 1 / total_distance if total_distance > 0 else float('inf')

    def rank_routes(self, population):
        return sorted(population, key=self.calculate_fitness, reverse=True)

    def selection(self, ranked_population):
        return ranked_population[:self.elite_size]

    def crossover(self, parent1, parent2):
        child = [None] * self.num_cities
        start_idx = random.randint(0, self.num_cities - 1)
        end_idx = random.randint(0, self.num_cities - 1)

        if start_idx < end_idx:
            child[start_idx:end_idx] = parent1[start_idx:end_idx]
        elif start_idx > end_idx:
            child[:end_idx] = parent1[:end_idx]
            child[start_idx:] = parent1[start_idx:]
        else:
            child = parent1

        for city in parent2:
            if city not in child:
                for i, gene in enumerate(child):
                    if gene is None:
                        child[i] = city
                        break

        return child

    def breed_population(self, selected_population):
        children = []
        for _ in range(self.population_size - self.elite_size):
            parent1 = random.choice(selected_population)
            parent2 = random.choice(selected_population)
            child = self.crossover(parent1, parent2)
            children.append(child)
        return children

    def mutate(self, route):
        for i in range(self.num_cities):
            if random.random() < self.mutation_rate:
                j = random.randint(0, self.num_cities - 1)
                route[i], route[j] = route[j], route[i]
        return route

    def mutate_population(self, population):
        return [self.mutate(route) for route in population]

    def evolve(self, num_generations):
        population = self.generate_initial_population()

        for generation in range(num_generations):
            ranked_population = self.rank_routes(population)
            selected_population = self.selection(ranked_population)
            children = self.breed_population(selected_population)
            population = selected_population + children
            population = self.mutate_population(population)

        best_route = max(population, key=self.calculate_fitness)
        return best_route

# Example usage
cities = [City(1, 1), City(4, 2), City(3, 6), City(7, 3), City(2, 10),
          City(6, 8), City(8, 5), City(9, 9), City(5, 7), City(10, 4)]
tsp = TravelingSalesman(cities)
best_route = tsp.evolve(num_generations=1000)
print("Best route:", [city.__dict__ for city in best_route])
```

Explanation:
- The code starts by defining two classes: `City` and `TravelingSalesman`.
- The `City` class represents a city on a 2D plane. It has `x` and `y` attributes to store the coordinates.
- The `TravelingSalesman` class represents the TSP problem. It has attributes like `cities` (a list of cities), `population_size`, `elite_size`, and `mutation_rate`.
- The `generate_initial_population` method creates an initial population of random routes (combinations of cities).
- The `calculate_fitness` method calculates the fitness of a given route by summing the distances between consecutive cities.
- The `rank_routes` method sorts the population based on fitness, in descending order.
- The `selection` method selects the top-ranked routes (elite) to be preserved for the next generation.
- The `crossover` method performs crossover between two parent routes to create a child route.
- The `breed_population` method creates a new population of children routes through crossover.
- The `mutate` method randomly swaps cities in a route to introduce genetic diversity.
- The `mutate_population` method applies mutation to the entire population.
- The `evolve` method evolves the population for a specified number of generations, applying selection, crossover, and mutation.
- Finally, an example usage is provided. The cities are defined, and a `TravelingSalesman` object is created. The `evolve` method is called to find the best route, and it is printed to the console.

This code demonstrates the implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve a complex optimization problem. It combines methods like selection, crossover, and mutation to iteratively improve the population of routes until a satisfactory solution is found.
