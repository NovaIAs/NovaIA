```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Preprocess the data
data = data.dropna()
data = data.drop_duplicates()

# Create a feature matrix and target vector
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a machine learning model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print('The accuracy of the model is:', score)

# Make predictions on new data
new_data = pd.DataFrame({'feature1': [1, 2, 3], 'feature2': [4, 5, 6]})
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
print('The predictions for the new data are:', predictions)

# Plot the results
plt.scatter(X_train['feature1'], X_train['feature2'], c=y_train, cmap='viridis')

# Save the model
joblib.dump(model, 'model.joblib')
```

This code is a complete machine learning workflow in Python. It loads the data, preprocesses it, creates a feature matrix and target vector, splits the data into training and testing sets, creates a machine learning model, trains the model, evaluates the model, makes predictions on new data, plots the results, and saves the model.

The code is well-commented and easy to understand. It uses a variety of Python libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.

This code can be used to solve a variety of machine learning problems. For example, it can be used to classify images, detect fraud, or predict customer churn.
