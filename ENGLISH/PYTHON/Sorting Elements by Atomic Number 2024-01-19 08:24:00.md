  # Create a list to store the sorted elements

  # Print the sorted elements

```

**Explanation:**

1. We define a dictionary called `elements` to store the elements and their atomic numbers.
2. We use the `sorted()` function to sort the elements by their atomic numbers. The `key` parameter specifies that we want to sort the elements based on their atomic numbers.
3. We iterate over the sorted elements and print the element name and its atomic number.
4. We use the `if __name__ == "__main__"` statement to ensure that the `main()` function is only called when the script is run directly, and not when it is imported.
