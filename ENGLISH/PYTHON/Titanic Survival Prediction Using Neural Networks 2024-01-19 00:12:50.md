This code is a Python script that uses the TensorFlow and Keras libraries to build and train a neural network model for predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The code is divided into several parts:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - The `data.csv` file is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Missing values are dropped from the DataFrame.
   - The `Gender` column is converted to a binary representation (1 for male, 0 for female).
   - One-hot encoding is applied to the `Country` column to create dummy variables for each country.
   - The data is split into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Creation**:
   - A sequential neural network model is created using the Keras Sequential API.
   - The model consists of three dense layers:
     - The first layer has 16 neurons and uses the ReLU activation function.
     - The second layer also has 16 neurons and uses the ReLU activation function.
     - The third layer has 1 neuron and uses the sigmoid activation function, which is suitable for binary classification tasks.

3. **Model Compilation**:
   - The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, the binary cross-entropy loss function, and the accuracy metric.

4. **Model Training**:
   - The model is trained on the training set for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The model is evaluated on the test set and the test loss and accuracy are printed.

6. **Predictions**:
   - Predictions are made on the test set using the trained model.

7. **Visualization**:
   - A scatter plot is created to visualize the actual versus predicted survival probabilities.

This code demonstrates the use of TensorFlow and Keras for building and training a neural network model for a binary classification task. It also includes data preprocessing and visualization steps for a comprehensive data analysis workflow.
