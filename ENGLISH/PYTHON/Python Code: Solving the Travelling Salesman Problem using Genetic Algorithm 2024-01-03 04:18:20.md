Certainly! Here's a complex and differentiated Python code that implements a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is an optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the starting city. The code uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of candidate solutions.

```python
import random

# Define the cities and their coordinates
cities = {
    'A': (2, 3),
    'B': (5, 8),
    'C': (1, 6),
    'D': (9, 2),
    'E': (4, 7)
}

# Genetic Algorithm parameters
population_size = 100
mutation_rate = 0.01
num_generations = 100

def calculate_distance(city_a, city_b):
    x1, y1 = city_a
    x2, y2 = city_b
    return ((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2) ** 0.5

def calculate_route_distance(route):
    total_distance = 0
    for i in range(len(route)):
        city_a = cities[route[i]]
        city_b = cities[route[(i + 1) % len(route)]]
        total_distance += calculate_distance(city_a, city_b)
    return total_distance

def generate_random_route():
    route = list(cities.keys())
    random.shuffle(route)
    return route

def initialize_population():
    population = []
    for _ in range(population_size):
        route = generate_random_route()
        population.append(route)
    return population

def crossover(parent1, parent2):
    cut_point = random.randint(1, len(parent1) - 1)
    child = parent1[:cut_point]
    for city in parent2:
        if city not in child:
            child.append(city)
    return child

def mutate(route):
    for i in range(len(route)):
        if random.random() < mutation_rate:
            j = random.randint(0, len(route) - 1)
            route[i], route[j] = route[j], route[i]
    return route

def select_parents(population):
    tournament_size = 5
    parents = []
    for _ in range(2):
        tournament = random.sample(population, tournament_size)
        best_route = min(tournament, key=calculate_route_distance)
        parents.append(best_route)
    return parents

def evolve_population(population):
    new_population = []
    while len(new_population) < population_size:
        parent1, parent2 = select_parents(population)
        child = crossover(parent1, parent2)
        child = mutate(child)
        new_population.append(child)
    return new_population

def find_best_route():
    population = initialize_population()

    for generation in range(num_generations):
        population = evolve_population(population)

    best_route = min(population, key=calculate_route_distance)
    return best_route

best_route = find_best_route()
best_distance = calculate_route_distance(best_route)

print("Best Route:", best_route)
print("Best Distance:", best_distance)
```

Explanation:
1. The code starts by defining the cities and their coordinates using a dictionary.
2. The genetic algorithm parameters are set, including the population size, mutation rate, and the number of generations.
3. The `calculate_distance` function calculates the Euclidean distance between two cities.
4. The `calculate_route_distance` function computes the total distance of a given route by summing the distances between consecutive cities.
5. The `generate_random_route` function generates a random route by shuffling the city names.
6. The `initialize_population` function creates an initial population of random routes.
7. The `crossover` function performs a single-point crossover between two parent routes to generate a child route.
8. The `mutate` function randomly swaps two cities in a given route with a probability determined by the mutation rate.
9. The `select_parents` function uses tournament selection to choose two parent routes with relatively low distance.
10. The `evolve_population` function evolves the population by selecting parents, performing crossover and mutation, and creating a new population.
11. The `find_best_route` function initializes the population and evolves it for the specified number of generations. It returns the best route found.
12. Finally, the best route and its distance are printed.

This code uses a genetic algorithm to iteratively improve the routes in the population until a near-optimal solution to the TSP is found.
