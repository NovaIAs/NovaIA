This code is a complex and differentiated code that is unlikely to be repeated again. It consists of several parts:

1. **Data loading and preprocessing:** This part of the code loads the data from a CSV file and preprocesses it by converting the 'Date' column to a datetime object, extracting the month and year from the date, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model training and evaluation:** This part of the code trains a linear regression model on the training data and evaluates it on the test data. It calculates the mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R2 score to assess the performance of the model.

3. **Cross-validation:** This part of the code performs cross-validation to estimate the model's performance on unseen data. It uses five-fold cross-validation to calculate the average score of the model on different subsets of the data.

4. **Plotting the results:** This part of the code plots a scatter plot of the actual values and predicted values to visualize the performance of the model.

5. **Saving the model:** This part of the code saves the trained model to a file using the pickle module.
