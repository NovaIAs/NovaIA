This code performs a comprehensive analysis of the correlations between features in a dataset.

1. It first loads the data from a CSV file and cleans it by removing any missing values.

2. The code then creates a list of all possible combinations of features and calculates the correlation coefficient for each pair of features using the Pearson correlation coefficient.

3. The correlations are sorted by strength and the top 10 correlations are printed.

4. Next, the code visualizes the correlation between the two features with the strongest correlation using a scatter plot.

5. Finally, a heatmap is created to show the correlations between all pairs of features, with the strength of the correlation represented by the color of the cell.

This code provides a detailed analysis of the relationships between features in a dataset, which can be useful for understanding the structure of the data and identifying potential relationships between variables.
