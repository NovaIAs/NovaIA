Here is a complex and differentiated code in Python that is unlikely to be repeated:

```python
import sympy
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

# Define a function to calculate the binomial coefficient
def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
    return factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n-k))

# Define a function to generate a random sample from a binomial distribution
def binomial_sample(n, p, size):
    return np.random.binomial(n, p, size)

# Define a function to fit a logistic regression model
def logistic_regression(X, y):
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X, y)
    return model

# Define a function to plot a ROC curve
def roc_curve(y_true, y_score):
    fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_true, y_score)
    plt.plot(fpr, tpr, label='ROC curve')
    plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
    plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
    plt.title('Receiver Operating Characteristic')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

# Generate a random sample from a binomial distribution
X = binomial_sample(100, 0.5, 1000)

# Fit a logistic regression model to the data
model = logistic_regression(X, y)

# Plot a ROC curve for the model
roc_curve(y_true, model.predict_proba(X)[:, 1])
```

This code is complex and differentiated because it uses a variety of Python libraries and functions to perform a variety of tasks, including:

* Calculating the factorial of a number
* Calculating the binomial coefficient
* Generating a random sample from a binomial distribution
* Fitting a logistic regression model to data
* Plotting a ROC curve

The code is also complex because it uses a variety of programming constructs, including:

* Functions
* Loops
* Conditional statements
* Object-oriented programming

This combination of complexity and differentiation makes the code unlikely to be repeated, even by experienced programmers.

Here is a brief explanation of the code:

* The `factorial()` function calculates the factorial of a number.
* The `binomial_coefficient()` function calculates the binomial coefficient.
* The `binomial_sample()` function generates a random sample from a binomial distribution.
* The `logistic_regression()` function fits a logistic regression model to data.
* The `roc_curve()` function plots a ROC curve for a model.

The code is used to generate a random sample from a binomial distribution, fit a logistic regression model to the data, and plot a ROC curve for the model.
