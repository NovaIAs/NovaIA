// This F# code defines a function called "mazeSolver" that implements a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve a maze represented as a two-dimensional array of characters.

// The maze is represented as a two-dimensional array of characters, where each character represents a cell in the maze. 
// The possible values for a cell are:
//  - 'S': Starting position
//  - 'E': Ending position
//  - 'W': Wall
//  - ' ': Open space

// The function takes the maze as input and returns a list of directions that lead from the starting position to the ending position.

// Here's an example of a maze:
//
//  S W W W
//  W W W W
//  W E W W
//  W W W W

// This maze can be solved by moving right, down, right, and then down again.

// The code uses a helper function called "isValidMove" to check if a move is valid. 
// A move is valid if it doesn't lead to a wall or outside the boundaries of the maze.

// The "mazeSolver" function uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to explore different paths through the maze. 
// It starts from the starting position and tries all possible moves. 
// If a move leads to a dead end, the function backtracks and tries a different move.

// Here's the code for the "mazeSolver" function:

let mazeSolver maze startingPosition endingPosition =

    // Check if the starting position is valid.
    if not (isValidMove maze startingPosition) then
        failwith "Invalid starting position."

    // Check if the ending position is valid.
    if not (isValidMove maze endingPosition) then
        failwith "Invalid ending position."

    // Create a stack to store the path from the starting position to the current position.
    let path = Stack()

    // Push the starting position onto the stack.
    path.Push(startingPosition)

    // While the stack is not empty, keep exploring paths through the maze.
    while (path.Count > 0) do

        // Pop the current position from the stack.
        let currentPosition = path.Pop()

        // Check if the current position is the ending position.
        if (currentPosition = endingPosition) then

            // Return the path that leads from the starting position to the ending position.
            path

        // Try all possible moves from the current position.
        for direction in ["Right"; "Down"; "Left"; "Up"] do

            // Get the next position in the given direction.
            let nextPosition = getNextPosition currentPosition direction

            // Check if the next position is valid.
            if (isValidMove maze nextPosition) then

                // Push the next position onto the stack.
                path.Push(nextPosition)

// The "isValidMove" function checks if a move is valid, given the maze and the current position.

let isValidMove maze position =

    // Check if the position is within the boundaries of the maze.
    if (position.X < 0 || position.X >= maze.GetLength(0) || position.Y < 0 || position.Y >= maze.GetLength(1)) then
        false

    // Check if the cell at the given position is not a wall.
    else if (maze.[position.X, position.Y] = 'W') then
        false

    // The move is valid.
    else
        true

// The "getNextPosition" function gets the next position in the given direction, given the current position.

let getNextPosition position direction =

    // Get the change in X and Y coordinates for the given direction.
    let deltaX, deltaY = match direction with
        | "Right" -> 1, 0
        | "Down" -> 0, 1
        | "Left" -> -1, 0
        | "Up" -> 0, -1

    // Calculate the next position.
    let nextPosition = { X = position.X + deltaX; Y = position.Y + deltaY }

    // Return the next position.
    nextPosition
