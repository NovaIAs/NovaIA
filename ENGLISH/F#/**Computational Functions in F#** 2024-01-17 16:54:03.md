This code provides a collection of functions for performing various mathematical and string-related operations, including calculating factorials, generating prime numbers, finding the greatest common divisor, generating Fibonacci sequences, converting numbers between bases, finding the longest common substring, generating subsets and combinations of a set, and more. These functions demonstrate a range of programming concepts and techniques, such as recursion, iteration, list comprehension, and pattern matching. The code is also well-commented to explain its functionality and structure.
