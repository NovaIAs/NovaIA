**Explanation:**

This code demonstrates a complex function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of strings. The function first groups the list of integers by their values using the `Seq.groupBy` function. This function takes a function that takes an integer and returns a key (in this case, the integer itself) and returns a sequence of tuples, where each tuple consists of a key and a sequence of all the integers in the list that have that key.

Once the list of integers has been grouped by their values, the code converts each group to a string using the `Seq.map` function. This function takes a function that takes a tuple (consisting of a key and a sequence of integers) and returns a string, and it applies that function to each tuple in the sequence. In this case, the function formats the tuple as a string of the form "key: value1, value2, ...".

Finally, the code converts the sequence of strings to an array using the `Seq.toArray` function. This function takes a sequence and returns an array that contains the elements of the sequence in the same order.

The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It first gets a list of integers from the user using the `Console.ReadLine()` function. Then, it calls the `complexFunction` function to process the list of integers and stores the result in a variable. Finally, it prints the result to the console using the `printfn` function.
