Explanation of the code:

* The first function, `crossEntropy`, calculates the cross-entropy loss between two probability distributions. The function takes as input the true labels and the predicted probabilities and returns the cross-entropy loss.
* The second function, `accuracy`, calculates the accuracy of a model on a given dataset. The function takes as input the true labels and the predicted labels and returns the accuracy of the model.
* The third function, `trainNeuralNetwork`, trains a neural network using the backpropagation algorithm. The function takes as input the neural network, the training data, the number of epochs, the learning rate, and the mini-batch size and returns the trained neural network.

The code is complex and differentiated because it implements a neural network training algorithm. The algorithm is complex because it involves multiple layers of neurons and complex mathematical operations. The algorithm is differentiated because it is able to learn from data and improve its performance over time.
