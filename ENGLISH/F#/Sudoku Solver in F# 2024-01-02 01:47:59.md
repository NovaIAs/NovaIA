Certainly! Here's a complex F# code that generates and solves a Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm:

```fsharp
open System

// Function to print the Sudoku grid
let printGrid (grid: int[,]) =
    printfn "-----------------------"
    for i = 0 to 8 do
        for j = 0 to 8 do
            printf "%d " grid.[i,j]
        printfn ""
    printfn "-----------------------"

// Function to check if a number can be placed in a specific position
let isValid (grid: int[,]) (row: int) (col: int) (num: int) =
    // Check row constraint
    for i = 0 to 8 do
        if grid.[row,i] = num then
            false

    // Check column constraint
    for i = 0 to 8 do
        if grid.[i,col] = num then
            false

    // Check box constraint
    let boxRow = (row / 3) * 3
    let boxCol = (col / 3) * 3
    for i = 0 to 2 do
        for j = 0 to 2 do
            if grid.[boxRow + i, boxCol + j] = num then
                false

    true

// Function to solve the Sudoku puzzle using backtracking
let rec solveSudoku (grid: int[,]) (row: int) (col: int) =
    if row = 9 then
        printGrid grid
        true
    else if col = 9 then
        solveSudoku grid (row + 1) 0
    else if grid.[row,col] <> 0 then
        solveSudoku grid row (col + 1)
    else
        for num = 1 to 9 do
            if isValid grid row col num then
                grid.[row,col] <- num
                if solveSudoku grid row (col + 1) then
                    true
                grid.[row,col] <- 0
        false

// Entry point of the program
[<EntryPoint>]
let main argv =
    let grid = Array2D.create 9 9 0

    // Input the initial Sudoku grid (0 for unknown cells)
    grid.[0,2] <- 5
    grid.[0,3] <- 3
    grid.[0,5] <- 7
    grid.[1,0] <- 6
    grid.[1,4] <- 1
    grid.[1,5] <- 9
    grid.[1,6] <- 5
    grid.[2,1] <- 9
    grid.[2,2] <- 8
    grid.[2,7] <- 6
    grid.[3,0] <- 8
    grid.[3,4] <- 6
    grid.[3,8] <- 3
    grid.[4,0] <- 4
    grid.[4,3] <- 8
    grid.[4,5] <- 3
    grid.[4,8] <- 1
    grid.[5,0] <- 7
    grid.[5,4] <- 2
    grid.[5,8] <- 6
    grid.[6,1] <- 6
    grid.[6,6] <- 2
    grid.[6,7] <- 8
    grid.[7,3] <- 4
    grid.[7,4] <- 1
    grid.[7,5] <- 9
    grid.[7,8] <- 5
    grid.[8,5] <- 8
    grid.[8,6] <- 7
    grid.[8,8] <- 9

    printfn "Sudoku puzzle:"
    printGrid grid
    printfn "Solving..."
    if solveSudoku grid 0 0 then
        printfn "Sudoku solution found."
    else
        printfn "No solution found for this Sudoku puzzle."

    0 // return an integer exit code
```

This code defines a Sudoku grid as a 2D array and uses a backtracking algorithm to solve it. The `printGrid` function simply prints the Sudoku grid to the console.

The `isValid` function checks if a number can be placed in a specific position in the grid, by verifying the row, column, and box constraints.

The `solveSudoku` function recursively solves the Sudoku puzzle by trying different numbers (1 to 9) in empty cells and backtracking when a number leads to an invalid solution.

In the entry point (`main`), an initial Sudoku grid is inputted, with 0 indicating unknown cells. The grid is then printed, and the `solveSudoku` function is called to solve it. Finally, the solution or failure message is displayed.
