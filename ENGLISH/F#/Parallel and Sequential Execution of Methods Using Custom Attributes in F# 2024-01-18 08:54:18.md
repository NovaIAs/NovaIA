Explanation:

1. Custom Attributes:
   - We define two custom attributes, `[<Parallel>]` and `[<Sequential>]`, to mark methods that should be executed in parallel or sequentially, respectively.

2. ParallelSequentialClass:
   - This class contains three methods:
     - `ParallelMethod`: This method is marked with the `[<Parallel>]` attribute, indicating that it should be executed in parallel.
     - `SequentialMethod`: This method is marked with the `[<Sequential>]` attribute, indicating that it should be executed sequentially.
     - `RunMethodsInParallel`: This method calls the `ParallelMethod` and `SequentialMethod` methods in parallel using Tasks.
     - `RunMethodsSequentially`: This method calls the `ParallelMethod` and `SequentialMethod` methods sequentially.

3. Usage:
   - We create an instance of the `ParallelSequentialClass` and call the `RunMethodsInParallel` and `RunMethodsSequentially` methods to demonstrate how the methods are executed in parallel and sequentially, respectively.

This code demonstrates how to use custom attributes to mark methods for parallel or sequential execution and then execute them accordingly. The use of Tasks allows for easy parallelization of tasks in F#.
