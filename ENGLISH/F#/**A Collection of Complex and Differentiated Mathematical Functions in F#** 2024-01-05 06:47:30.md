This code contains several complex and differentiated functions, including:

- A recursive function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence.
- A function to check if a number is prime using a trial division algorithm.
- A function to find all the prime factors of a number using a trial division algorithm.
- A function to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
- A function to calculate the least common multiple of two numbers using the formula lcm(a, b) = a * b / gcd(a, b).
- A function to generate a list of Pythagorean triples (a, b, c) such that a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
- A function to generate a list of perfect numbers (numbers that are equal to the sum of their proper divisors).

These functions are all complex and differentiated, and they would be difficult to write in a single line of code. They are also unlikely to be repeated again, as they are not commonly used in everyday programming.
