This F# code initializes a generic collection (IDictionary<,>) called "personInfo" using a for-loop to iterate through a range of integers. Inside the loop, a composite key is constructed by concatenating a "person" prefix with the current integer, followed by a value that combines the integer with a "name" prefix.

The dictionary is then populated with these key-value pairs. This code showcases the use of a generic collection and demonstrates an example of how to initialize it with a series of key-value pairs.

```f#
// Initialize a generic dictionary to store person information
let personInfo =
    // Use a for-loop to iterate through a range of integers
    for i in 1 .. 10 do
        // Construct a composite key for the dictionary
        let key = "person" + i.ToString()

        // Create a value for the dictionary entry
        let value = "name" + i.ToString()

        // Add the key-value pair to the dictionary
        yield key, value

// Iterate through the dictionary and print the key-value pairs
for (key, value) in personInfo do
    printfn "%s: %s" key value
```

Explanation:

1. `let personInfo =` initializes a generic collection called `personInfo` of type `IDictionary<string, string>`. This collection will be used to store person information, with the key being a unique identifier and the value being the person's name.

2. `for i in 1 .. 10 do` starts a loop that iterates from 1 to 10, inclusive. This loop is used to generate key-value pairs for the dictionary.

3. Inside the loop, `let key = "person" + i.ToString()` constructs the key for the current person. The key is created by concatenating the string "person" with the current value of `i` converted to a string. This results in keys like "person1", "person2", "person3", and so on.

4. `let value = "name" + i.ToString()` constructs the value for the current person. Similar to the key, the value is created by concatenating the string "name" with the current value of `i` converted to a string. This results in values like "name1", "name2", "name3", and so on.

5. `yield key, value` adds the key-value pair to the dictionary. The `yield` keyword is used because the `personInfo` collection is being initialized using a generator expression.

6. `for (key, value) in personInfo do` iterates through the `personInfo` dictionary and prints the key-value pairs.

This code demonstrates how to initialize a generic collection in F# using a for-loop and generator expression. It also shows how to iterate through the collection and access the key-value pairs.
