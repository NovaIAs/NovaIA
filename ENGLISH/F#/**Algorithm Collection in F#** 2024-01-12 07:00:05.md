**Explanation:**

This code contains a collection of complex and differentiated functions in F#, covering a wide range of algorithms and data structures. Here's a brief explanation of each function:

1. **factorial**: Calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.

2. **fibonacci**: Generates the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.

3. **isPrime**: Checks if a given number is prime using a helper function for efficiency.

4. **toRoman**: Converts a number to its Roman numeral representation using a list of Roman numeral symbols.

5. **longestCommonSubstring**: Finds the longest common substring between two strings using dynamic programming.

6. **shortestPath**: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

7. **maxSubarraySum**: Calculates the maximum sum of a subarray in an array using Kadane's algorithm.

8. **minNumberOfCoins**: Determines the minimum number of coins needed to make a change for a given amount using dynamic programming.

9. **knapsack**: Solves the 0-1 knapsack problem using dynamic programming to find the maximum value subset of items that can be accommodated within a given capacity.

10. **longestIncreasingSubsequence**: Finds the longest increasing subsequence in an array using dynamic programming.

11. **minEditDistance**: Calculates the minimum number of edits (insertions, deletions, or replacements) required to transform one string into another using dynamic programming.

These functions demonstrate various programming techniques and cover a wide range of algorithms and applications. They are commonly used in competitive programming, optimization problems, and data analysis, among other areas.
