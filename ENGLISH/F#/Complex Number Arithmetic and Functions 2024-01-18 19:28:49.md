This code defines a custom type called `Complex` to represent complex numbers. It also defines several functions to perform various operations on complex numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, absolute value, argument, complex conjugate, exponential function, natural logarithm, square root, trigonometric sine, trigonometric cosine, trigonometric tangent, hyperbolic sine, hyperbolic cosine, and hyperbolic tangent.

To use this code, you can create instances of the `Complex` type and then use the various functions to perform operations on them. For example, to add two complex numbers, you can use the `Add` function like this:

```f#
let c1 = { Real = 1.0; Imaginary = 2.0 }
let c2 = { Real = 3.0; Imaginary = 4.0 }
let c3 = Add c1 c2
```

The value of `c3` will be the complex number `4.0 + 6.0i`.

You can also use the other functions to perform other operations on complex numbers. For example, to calculate the absolute value of a complex number, you can use the `Abs` function like this:

```f#
let c = { Real = 1.0; Imaginary = 2.0 }
let abs = Abs c
```

The value of `abs` will be the real number `2.23606797749979`.
