This code is a collection of functions that perform various mathematical operations on lists of integers. The functions include:

* `crossProduct`: This function takes two lists of integers and returns a list of tuples, each tuple containing an integer from the first list and an integer from the second list.
* `fst`: This function takes a list of tuples and returns a list of the first elements of each tuple.
* `snd`: This function takes a list of tuples and returns a list of the second elements of each tuple.
* `primeFactors`: This function takes a list of integers and returns a list of the prime factors of each integer.
* `greatestCommonDivisors`: This function takes a list of integers and returns a list of the greatest common divisors of each pair of integers.
* `leastCommonMultiples`: This function takes a list of integers and returns a list of the least common multiples of each pair of integers.
* `relativelyPrime`: This function takes a list of integers and returns a list of the numbers that are relatively prime to each integer.

These functions can be used to perform a variety of mathematical operations on lists of integers. For example, the `primeFactors` function can be used to find the prime factorization of a number, and the `greatestCommonDivisors` function can be used to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
