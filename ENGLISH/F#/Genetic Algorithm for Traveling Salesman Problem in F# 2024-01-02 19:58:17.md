Certainly! Here's a complex and unique F# code that implements a genetic algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem. The traveling salesman problem is a classic algorithmic problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the starting city.

```fsharp
open System
open System.Collections.Generic

type City = { Name: string; X: float; Y: float }
type Route = City list

let calculateDistance (city1: City) (city2: City) =
    let dx = city2.X - city1.X
    let dy = city2.Y - city1.Y
    sqrt (dx * dx + dy * dy)

let calculateTotalDistance (route: Route) =
    let rec loop distance prevCity = function
        | [] -> distance + calculateDistance (List.head route) prevCity
        | city::rest -> loop (distance + calculateDistance prevCity city) city rest
    loop 0.0 (List.head route) (List.tail route)

let generateRandomRoute (cities: City list) =
    let random = Random()
    cities |> List.sortBy (fun _ -> random.Next())
           |> List.toArray

let mutateRoute (route: Route) =
    let random = Random()
    let i = random.Next(route.Length)
    let j = random.Next(route.Length)
    route.[i], route.[j] <- route.[j], route.[i]
    route

let crossoverRoutes (parent1: Route) (parent2: Route) =
    let random = Random()
    let i = random.Next(parent1.Length)
    let j = random.Next(parent1.Length)
    let child1 = Array.copy parent1
    let child2 = Array.copy parent2
    for k in i..j do
        child1.[k] <- parent2.[k]
        child2.[k] <- parent1.[k]
    child1, child2

let createInitialPopulation (cities: City list) (populationSize: int) =
    [ for _ in 1..populationSize -> generateRandomRoute cities ]

let evolve (cities: City list) (populationSize: int) (numGenerations: int) =
    let population = createInitialPopulation cities populationSize
    let rec loop generation population =
        match generation with
        | 0 -> population
        | _ ->
            let sortedPopulation = population |> List.sortBy calculateTotalDistance
            let eliteSize = int32 (populationSize * 0.2)
            let elite = sortedPopulation |> List.take eliteSize
            let offspringSize = populationSize - eliteSize
            let offspring =
                [ for _ in 1..offspringSize ->
                    let parent1, parent2 = elite.[random.Next eliteSize], elite.[random.Next eliteSize]
                    let child1, child2 = crossoverRoutes parent1 parent2
                    mutateRoute child1
                    mutateRoute child2
                    child1
                    child2 ]
            loop (generation - 1) (elite @ offspring)
    loop numGenerations population

let cities =
    [
        { Name = "A"; X = 0.0; Y = 0.0 }
        { Name = "B"; X = 1.0; Y = 1.0 }
        { Name = "C"; X = 2.0; Y = 2.0 }
        { Name = "D"; X = 3.0; Y = 4.0 }
        { Name = "E"; X = 4.0; Y = 5.0 }
    ]

let populationSize = 100
let numGenerations = 100

let bestRoute = evolve cities populationSize numGenerations |> List.minBy calculateTotalDistance

printfn "Best route found: %A" bestRoute
```

This code implements a genetic algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem. It defines the `City` and `Route` types to represent cities and routes, respectively. The `calculateDistance` function calculates the Euclidean distance between two cities. The `calculateTotalDistance` function calculates the total distance of a given route. The `generateRandomRoute` function generates a random route by shuffling the order of the cities. The `mutateRoute` function randomly swaps two cities in a route. The `crossoverRoutes` function performs a crossover operation between two parent routes to generate two child routes. The `createInitialPopulation` function generates an initial population of random routes. The `evolve` function evolves the population over a specified number of generations.

In the main part of the code, a list of cities is defined, along with the population size and the number of generations. The `evolve` function is called with these parameters, and the best route found is printed at the end.

Please note that the code provided is just an example, and there are many possible variations of genetic algorithms for solving the traveling salesman problem. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code according to your needs.
