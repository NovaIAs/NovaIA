Explanation:

This code defines a data type called `Contract` that can represent a contract with a unique ID and a list of clauses. Each clause can be either an inclusion clause, an exclusion clause, or a direct clause.

The code also defines a function called `clausePredicate` that can be used to match a clause based on its identifier.

The `printContract` function is used to print a contract to the console.

The `createContract` function is used to create a contract from a list of clauses.

The `main` function is the entry point for the program. It creates two contracts, prints them to the console, and then returns a code of 0.
