This code is a collection of mathematical functions written in F#. The functions include:

* factorial: Calculates the factorial of a number.
* fibonacci: Calculates the nth Fibonacci number.
* gcd: Calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
* lcm: Calculates the least common multiple of two numbers.
* isPrime: Checks if a number is prime.
* primeFactors: Finds all the prime factors of a number.
* perfectNumbers: Finds all the perfect numbers less than a given number.
* amicableNumbers: Finds all the amicable numbers less than a given number.

The code is well-commented and uses a recursive approach to solve the problems. The functions are all tail-recursive, which means that they can be efficiently compiled to machine code.

To use the code, you can simply copy and paste it into a F# script file (.fsx) and then run the file. The results will be printed to the console.
