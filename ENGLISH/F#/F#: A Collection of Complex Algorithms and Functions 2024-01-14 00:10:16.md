This code is a collection of various complex and differentiated algorithms and functions written in F#. It includes functions to calculate the factorial of a number, calculate the Fibonacci sequence, check if a number is prime, find the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of two numbers, calculate the sum of the digits of a number, reverse a string, check if a string is a palindrome, find the longest common substring of two strings, find the longest increasing subsequence of a list, find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, find the minimum spanning tree of a graph, and find the maximum independent set of a graph. Each function is explained in detail in the comments.
