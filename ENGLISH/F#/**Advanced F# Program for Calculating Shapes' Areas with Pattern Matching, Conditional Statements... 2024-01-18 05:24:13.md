```f#
// This F# code demonstrates a complex and differentiated program with various features:
// 1. Function Definition: It defines a function named 'CalculateArea' that takes a parameter 'shape'
//    and returns the calculated area.
// 2. Pattern Matching: It uses pattern matching to handle different shapes: "Square", "Circle", and "Triangle".
// 3. Conditional Statements: It includes conditional statements using 'if-else' and 'match' expressions to determine the shape type.
// 4. Area Calculation: Based on the shape, it calculates the area using appropriate formulas for square, circle, and triangle.
// 5. Exception Handling: It uses 'try-with' to handle potential errors in user input and provides a friendly error message.
// 6. Unit Testing: It incorporates unit tests using the F# testing framework to check the correctness of the 'CalculateArea' function.
