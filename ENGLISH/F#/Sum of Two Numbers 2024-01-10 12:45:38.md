This code takes two numbers as input and prints their sum.

The first line of the code declares the main function. The main function is the entry point of the program. It takes an array of strings as its argument. The array of strings contains the command-line arguments that were passed to the program.

The second line of the code checks if the user has provided two arguments. If the user has not provided two arguments, the program prints an error message and exits.

The third and fourth lines of the code parse the two arguments as integers. The `int` function converts a string to an integer.

The fifth line of the code prints the sum of the two numbers. The `printfn` function is used to print formatted output. The `%d` format specifier is used to print an integer.

The sixth line of the code calls the main function. The `Sys.argv` array contains the command-line arguments that were passed to the program.
