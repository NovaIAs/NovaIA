This code contains a collection of complex and differentiated functions that perform various mathematical and algorithmic tasks. These functions are explained in detail below:

1. `factorial`: Calculates the factorial of a given number `n` using a recursive definition.

2. `primes`: Generates a list of prime numbers up to a given number `n` using a recursive function that checks for primality.

3. `gcd`: Calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.

4. `lcm`: Calculates the least common multiple of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `lcm(a, b) = a * b / gcd(a, b)`.

5. `smallestMultiple`: Finds the smallest positive integer divisible by all integers from 1 to `n` using a recursive function.

6. `change`: Calculates the number of ways to make change for a given amount of money `amount` using coins of different denominations `coins` using dynamic programming.

7. `subsets`: Generates all possible subsets of a given set `set` using a recursive function.

8. `lcs`: Finds the longest common subsequence of two strings `s1` and `s2` using dynamic programming.

9. `dijkstra`: Finds the shortest path from a given source vertex `source` to all other vertices in a weighted graph `graph` using Dijkstra's algorithm.

10. `maxIndependentSet`: Finds the maximum independent set in a graph `graph` using dynamic programming.

11. `minVertexCover`: Finds the minimum vertex cover in a graph `graph` using dynamic programming.

These functions cover a wide range of topics in mathematics and computer science, and they demonstrate the expressive power of F# for solving complex problems. They can be used as building blocks for more complex programs or as standalone tools for solving specific problems.
