This code is a collection of different functions that perform various mathematical and graph-related operations. Here's a brief explanation of each function:

1. `factorial`: Calculates the factorial of a given number.

2. `primes`: Generates a list of prime numbers up to a given limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

3. `sumOfSquares`: Calculates the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers.

4. `fibonacci`: Generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a given limit.

5. `longestCommonSubsequence`: Finds the longest common subsequence of two strings using dynamic programming.

6. `shortestPath`: Finds the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.

7. `maximumIndependentSet`: Finds the maximum independent set in a graph using a recursive backtracking algorithm.

8. `minimumSpanningTree`: Finds the minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph using Prim's algorithm.

9. `maximumClique`: Finds the maximum clique in a graph
