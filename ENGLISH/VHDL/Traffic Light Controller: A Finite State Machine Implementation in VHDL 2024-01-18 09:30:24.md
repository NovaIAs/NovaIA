-- This is a very large and complex VHDL code.
-- It is unlikely to be repeated again.

-- The code implements a finite state machine (FSM) that controls a traffic light.
-- The FSM has three states: red, yellow, and green.
-- The FSM transitions from one state to another based on the input signals.

-- The input signals are:
-- - sensor_north: This signal is asserted when a car is detected at the north intersection.
-- - sensor_south: This signal is asserted when a car is detected at the south intersection.
-- - sensor_east: This signal is asserted when a car is detected at the east intersection.
-- - sensor_west: This signal is asserted when a car is detected at the west intersection.

-- The output signals are:
-- - light_north: This signal controls the north traffic light.
-- - light_south: This signal controls the south traffic light.
-- - light_east: This signal controls the east traffic light.
-- - light_west: This signal controls the west traffic light.

-- The FSM is implemented using a case statement.
-- The case statement transitions from one state to another based on the input signals.

**Explanation:**

The VHDL code implements a finite state machine (FSM) that controls a traffic light.
The FSM has three states: red, yellow, and green.
The FSM transitions from one state to another based on the input signals.

The input signals are:

* `sensor_north`: This signal is asserted when a car is detected at the north intersection.
* `sensor_south`: This signal is asserted when a car is detected at the south intersection.
* `sensor_east`: This signal is asserted when a car is detected at the east intersection.
* `sensor_west`: This signal is asserted when a car is detected at the west intersection.

The output signals are:

* `light_north`: This signal controls the north traffic light.
* `light_south`: This signal controls the south traffic light.
* `light_east`: This signal controls the east traffic light.
* `light_west`: This signal controls the west traffic light.

The FSM is implemented using a case statement.
The case statement transitions from one state to another based on the input signals.

The following is a brief explanation of the code:

* The `process` statement is used to implement the FSM.
* The `case` statement is used to transition from one state to another.
* The `after` statement is used to delay the transition from the yellow state to the green state.
* The `light_north`, `light_south`, `light_east`, and `light_west` signals are assigned values based on the current state.

This code is very complex and it is unlikely to be repeated again.
It is a good example of how VHDL can be used to implement complex systems.
