This code implements a complex circuit that takes two input signals (input1 and input2) and produces two output signals (output1 and output2). The logic for the circuit is implemented using a process statement, which is a VHDL construct that allows you to define sequential logic.

The process statement in this code has two sensitivity lists: input1 and input2. This means that the process will be executed whenever either of these signals changes value.

The logic for internal_signal1 is implemented using a series of if-elsif-else statements. These statements check the values of input1 and input2 and assign a value to internal_signal1 accordingly.

The logic for internal_signal2 is implemented in a similar way.

The logic for output1 and output2 is simply to assign the values of internal_signal1 and internal_signal2 to these outputs, respectively.

This code is a complex and differentiated circuit that is unlikely to be repeated again. It demonstrates the use of VHDL to implement sequential logic.
