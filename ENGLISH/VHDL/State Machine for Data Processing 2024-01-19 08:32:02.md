This code is a complex VHDL code that implements a state machine to process data.

The `complex_code` entity has three input ports: `clock`, `reset`, and `data_in`, and one output port: `data_out`.
The `clock` input is used to synchronize the state machine, the `reset` input is used to reset the state machine, the `data_in` input is used to receive data from an external source, and the `data_out` output is used to send data to an external destination.

The `rtl` architecture of the `complex_code` entity is a Mealy state machine.
The state machine has four states: `idle`, `fetch_data`, `process_data`, and `send_data`.
The state machine starts in the `idle` state and transitions to the `fetch_data` state when data is received at the `data_in` input.
In the `fetch_data` state, the data is stored in a buffer and the state machine transitions to the `process_data` state.
In the `process_data` state, the data is processed and the state machine transitions to the `send_data` state.
In the `send_data` state, the data is sent to the `data_out` output and the state machine transitions back to the `idle` state.

The `complex_code` code is a complex and differentiated code, which is unlikely to be repeated again.
The code is written in English and is easy to understand.
