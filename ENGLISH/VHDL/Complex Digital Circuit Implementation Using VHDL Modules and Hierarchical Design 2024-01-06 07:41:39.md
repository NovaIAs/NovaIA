Explanation:

- The top-level module, System, defines the external inputs and outputs of the circuit and includes the component declarations for the Register and Multiplexer modules.

- The Behavioral architecture of System instantiates the Register and Multiplexer components and connects them together. The multiplex select signal (mux_sel) is generated based on the clock and reset signals.

- The Register component implements an 8-bit register that captures data on the rising edge of the clock when the reset signal is inactive.

- The Multiplexer component implements a simple 2-to-1 multiplexer that selects between two 8-bit data inputs (data_in0 and data_in1) based on the select signal (sel).

- The circuit's functionality is as follows:
  - Data is input through the data_in port.
  - The register captures the data when the clock rises and the reset is inactive.
  - The multiplexer selects between the input data and the register data based on the mux_sel signal.
  - The selected data is output through the data_out port.

This code demonstrates a more complex circuit design using multiple modules and hierarchical design in VHDL. It illustrates the use of components and the interconnection of different functional blocks to achieve the desired functionality.
