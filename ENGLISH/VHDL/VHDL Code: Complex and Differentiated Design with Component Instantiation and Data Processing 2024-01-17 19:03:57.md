Explanation:

1. **Component Declaration**: The `complex_component` component is defined with input ports for clock (clk), reset (rst), and data input (data_in), and an output port for data output (data_out).

2. **Architecture Declaration for `complex_component`**: Inside the `rtl` architecture of the `complex_component`, there are two processes: one for data processing and one for output generation.

   - Data Processing Process: This process multiplies the input data `data_in` by 2 and stores the result in `temp_data`. This process is triggered by the rising edge of the clock and reset input.

   - Output Generation Process: This process simply assigns the `temp_data` to the output `data_out` on the rising edge of the clock.

3. **Entity Declaration for `top_entity`**: The top-level entity `top_entity` has the same input and output ports as the `complex_component`.

4. **Architecture Declaration for `top_entity`**: This architecture instantiates the `complex_component` within the top-level entity. It uses the `uut` as the instance name.

5. **Component Instantiation**: The `uut` instance of the `complex_component` is connected to the ports of the top-level entity.

6. **Output Assignment**: The final output `data_out` is calculated by adding 1 to the `intermediate_data` obtained from the `complex_component`.

This VHDL code implements a complex design where the `complex_component` takes input data, multiplies it by 2, and then the top-level entity adds 1 to the result. The main purpose of this code is to demonstrate a complex and differentiated design, rather than a practical application.
