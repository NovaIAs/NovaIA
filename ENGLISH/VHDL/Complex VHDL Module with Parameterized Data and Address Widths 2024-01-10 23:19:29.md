This VHDL code implements a complex module that can be used as a memory or a register file. The module is parameterized with the data width and the address width, which allows it to be used in various applications. The module has a clock input, a reset input, a data input, an address input, and a data output.

The module uses a process to implement the memory. The process is clocked by the clock input and is reset by the reset input. When the clock rises, the process checks if the reset input is active. If the reset input is active, the memory is cleared. Otherwise, the data input is stored in the memory location specified by the address input.

The data output of the module is the data stored in the memory location specified by the address input.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

* The `generic` section of the code defines the parameters of the module. In this case, the parameters are the data width and the address width.
* The `port` section of the code defines the ports of the module. In this case, the ports are the clock input, the reset input, the data input, the address input, and the data output.
* The `architecture` section of the code defines the implementation of the module. In this case, the implementation uses a process to implement the memory.
* The `process` statement is used to implement the memory. The process is clocked by the clock input and is reset by the reset input.
* The `if` statement inside the process checks if the reset input is active. If the reset input is active, the memory is cleared.
* The `else` statement inside the process stores the data input in the memory location specified by the address input.
* The `data_out` signal is assigned to the data stored in the memory location specified by the address input.

This code can be used to implement a variety of complex modules, such as memories, register files, and FIFOs.
