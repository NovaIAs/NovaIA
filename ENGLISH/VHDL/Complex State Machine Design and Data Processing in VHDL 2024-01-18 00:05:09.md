**Explanation:**

1. **Library and Entity:**
   - The code starts by defining the library and the entity.
   - The entity, `complex_design`, has three ports: `clk` (clock input), `reset` (reset input), `data_in` (8-bit input data), and `data_out` (16-bit output data).


2. **Architecture:**
   - The architecture, `complex_arch`, defines the implementation details of the entity.


3. **Internal Signals:**
   - `data_reg`: This is a 16-bit register to store the input data and intermediate results.
   - `state`: This is a 2-bit state variable to control the state machine.


4. **State Machine Process:**
   - The state machine process is the core of the design.
   - It responds to the clock and reset inputs to transition between states and perform various operations.


5. **State Machine States:**
   - The state machine has three states:
     - `"00"`: Initial state where input data is read and stored.
     - `"01"`: Intermediate state where calculations are performed on the data.
     - `"10"`: Final state where the calculated data is output.


6. **State Transitions:**
   - When the reset input is asserted, the state machine is reset to the initial state `"00"`.
   - On each rising edge of the clock, the state machine transitions between states based on the current state and the input data.


7. **Data Processing:**
   - In the intermediate state `"01"`, the data in the register is multiplied by 2 and then incremented by 1.
   - This is an example of a complex calculation that can be performed in this state.


8. **Output Data:**
   - In the final state `"10"`, the calculated data in the register is output through the `data_out` port.


9. **State Machine Wrap-Around:**
   - After outputting the data, the state machine transitions back to the initial state `"00"` to start the process again.

This VHDL code demonstrates a complex design with a state machine, data processing, and output handling. It showcases the versatility and capabilities of VHDL as a hardware description language.
