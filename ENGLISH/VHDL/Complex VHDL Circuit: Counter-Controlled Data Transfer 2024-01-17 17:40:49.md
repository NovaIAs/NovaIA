**Explanation:**

* The `ComplexCircuit` entity defines the input and output ports of the circuit, including an 8-bit data input (`din`) and a 16-bit data output (`dout`).
* The `RTL` architecture contains the logic implementation of the circuit using VHDL processes.
* A 4-bit counter (`count`) is implemented using a clocked process that increments the counter on each rising edge of the clock.
* A 16-bit register (`data_reg`) is used to store the input data.
* The data register is updated with the input data when the counter reaches its maximum value, which ensures that the data is stored only once per input cycle.
* The output data (`dout`) is assigned the value stored in the data register.

This VHDL code implements a complex and differentiated circuit that involves a counter, a data register, and controlled data transfer based on the counter's value. It showcases the use of VHDL processes and signal assignments to create a functional digital circuit.
