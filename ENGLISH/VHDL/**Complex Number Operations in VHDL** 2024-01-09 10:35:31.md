Explanation:

* The code defines a complex data type, which is a record with two real components, the real part and the imaginary part.
* It defines a generic function to add two complex numbers. The function takes two complex numbers as arguments and returns a complex number as a result.
* It defines a generic procedure to print a complex number. The procedure takes a complex number as an argument and prints it to the console.
* The main program declares three variables of type Complex, initializes them with values, calls the Add_Complex function to add the two complex numbers, calls the Print_Complex procedure to print the result, waits for 10 seconds, and prints a message to the console.
