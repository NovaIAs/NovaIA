**Explanation:**

This VHDL code implements a complex and differentiated design, utilizing advanced features of the language.

- It defines a library and a package for reusable components and types, including custom data types and component declarations for submodules.
- In the top-level architecture, it instantiates submodules, including adder, multiplier, and a complex multiplier.
- It connects the submodules' ports and assigns signals for temporary results and complex results.

This code demonstrates a more intricate and elaborate design, showcasing the capabilities of VHDL for building complex systems with reusable components and custom data types.
