-- This VHDL code implements a complex and differentiated design that is unlikely to be repeated again.
-- The code is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable.

-- Define the entity and architecture of the design.

**Explanation:**

* The `complex_design` entity defines the input and output ports of the design.
* The `rtl` architecture defines the internal signals and components of the design.
* The `data_path` component implements the data path of the design, which performs the actual processing of the data.
* The `control_unit` component implements the control unit of the design, which generates the control signals that control the operation of the data path.
* The `u_data_path` and `u_control_unit` instances instantiate the `data_path` and `control_unit` components, respectively.
* The `data_out` signal is the output of the design, which is the processed data.

This code is complex and differentiated because it implements a design that is not easily repeated. The design is modular, scalable, and maintainable, which makes it easy to modify and expand in the future.
