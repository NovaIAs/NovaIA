Explanation:

* The `entity` declaration defines the interface of the program, including the input and output ports.
* The `architecture` declaration defines the implementation of the program, including the internal signals and the behavior of the program.
* The `intermediate_data` signal is used to store the intermediate results of the calculations.
* The `output_data` signal is used to store the final output of the program.
* The `perform some complex calculations on the input data` line performs some complex calculations on the input data.
* The `perform some additional calculations on the intermediate data` line performs some additional calculations on the intermediate data.
* The `output_data := intermediate_data(15 downto 8) + intermediate_data(7 downto 0);` line assigns the final output of the program to the `output_data` signal.
* The `end behavioral;` line ends the definition of the architecture.
