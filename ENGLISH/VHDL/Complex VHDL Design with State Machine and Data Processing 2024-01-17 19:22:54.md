**Explanation:**

This VHDL code implements a complex design combining a state machine with data processing and output generation. Here's how it works:

1. **Entity Declaration:**
    - The 'ComplexDesign' entity defines the inputs and outputs of the design, including a clock (clk), reset (rst), input data (data_in), and output data (data_out).

2. **Architecture Declaration:**
    - The 'Behavioral' architecture contains the implementation details of the design.

3. **Internal Signals:**
    - A state variable (current_state) is used to control the behavior of the design.
    - A buffer (data_buffer) is utilized to store intermediate data.

4. **State Machine Process:**
    - The state machine process is driven by the clock (clk) and reset (rst) signals.
    - It transitions through different states (Idle, Read, Process, Write) based on the input data and the current state.
    - In the 'Read' state, data is read from the input (data_in) and stored in the buffer (data_buffer).
    - In the 'Process' state, complex processing is performed on the buffered data.
    - In the 'Write' state, the processed data is written to the output (data_out).

5. **Output Process:**
    - The output process is also driven by the clock (clk).
    - When in the 'Write' state, it generates the output data (data_out) by doubling the buffered data.

This code showcases a sophisticated design involving state machine control, data processing, and output generation, making it a comprehensive and unique implementation.
