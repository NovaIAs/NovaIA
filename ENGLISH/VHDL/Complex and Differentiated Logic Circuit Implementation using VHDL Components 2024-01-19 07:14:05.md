Explanation:

1. Entity Declaration:
   - The `ComplexCircuit` entity defines the input and output ports of the circuit.
   - It has a clock input (CLK), a reset input (RST), an 8-bit data input (DATA_IN), and a 16-bit data output (DATA_OUT).

2. Architecture Declaration:
   - The `Behavioral` architecture contains the implementation details of the circuit.

3. Internal Signals and Components:
   - `RegOut` is an 8-bit signal that represents the output of the register.
   - `AdderOut` is a 16-bit signal that represents the output of the adder.
   - `MuxOut` is a 16-bit signal that represents the output of the multiplexer.
   - Three components (`Register`, `Adder`, and `Multiplexer`) are declared and later instantiated within the architecture.

4. Component Instantiation:
   - The `Register_Inst` component is instantiated with the specified port connections.
   - The `Adder_Inst` component is instantiated with the specified port connections.
   - The `Mux_Inst` component is instantiated with the specified port connections.

5. Output Assignment:
   - The `DATA_OUT` output port is assigned to the output of the multiplexer (`MuxOut`).

This circuit performs the following operations:

1. It stores the 8-bit data input in a register when the reset signal (RST) is high.
2. It adds the register output to the data input and stores the result in the register when RST is low.
3. It multiplexes between the adder output and the data input based on the reset signal.
4. The final output (DATA_OUT) is the result of the multiplexer, which is either the adder output or the data input, depending on the reset signal.

This circuit effectively implements a combination of register, adder, and multiplexer operations to achieve a complex and differentiated behavior.
