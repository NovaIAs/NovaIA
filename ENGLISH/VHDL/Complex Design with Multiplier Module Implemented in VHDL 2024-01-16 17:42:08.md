-- This code implements a complex design that includes a multiplier module. The multiplier module takes two 8-bit inputs and produces a 16-bit output. The top-level entity registers the input and output data and controls the multiplier module. The code is well-commented and organized for easy understanding.

-- The multiplier module is implemented using a shift-and-add algorithm. It uses a series of adders and shifters to multiply the two input numbers. The output of the multiplier is registered and then sent to the top-level entity.

-- The top-level entity registers the input and output data and controls the multiplier module. It uses a clock and reset signal to control the operation of the design. The input data is registered on the rising edge of the clock. The output data is registered on the rising edge of the clock after the multiplier has completed its operation.
