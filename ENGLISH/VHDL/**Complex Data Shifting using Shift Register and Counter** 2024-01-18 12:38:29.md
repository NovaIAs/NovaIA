**Explanation:**

This VHDL code is designed to implement a complex data shifting operation. Here's how it works:

- The code defines an entity called `complex_entity` with three ports: `clk` (clock input), `rst` (reset input), `data_in` (8-bit input data), and `data_out` (16-bit output data).

- The architecture `behavioral` is defined for the entity, which contains the implementation details.

- Several internal signals are defined, including `shift_register` (a 16-bit shift register) and `count` (an integer used to track the shifting operation).

- The combinatorial logic simply assigns the value of `shift_register` to the `data_out` port, making the current state of the shift register available at the output.

- The core functionality is implemented in a process that is sensitive to the clock `clk`.

- When a rising edge is detected on the clock, the process executes.

- If the `rst` input is asserted, the shift register and count are reset, clearing the data and starting the shifting operation from the beginning.

- The process then checks the value of `count`. If `count` is equal to 15, it means the shifting operation is complete, so it resets `count` to 0 and shifts the `data_in` into the shift register, pushing the previous data to the right.

- If `count` is not equal to 15, it increments `count` and shifts the data in the shift register to the right by one bit, effectively shifting in a '0' from the left.

- The result of the shifting operation is continuously stored in the `shift_register`. When the shifting operation is complete, the shifted data is available at the `data_out` port.

This VHDL code demonstrates a complex data shifting operation, where data is continuously shifted in one direction, allowing for manipulation and processing of data streams. Such operations are commonly used in digital signal processing and other applications.
