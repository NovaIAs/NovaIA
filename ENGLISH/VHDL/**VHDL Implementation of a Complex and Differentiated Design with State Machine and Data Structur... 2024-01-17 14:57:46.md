Explanation:

1. The code defines a VHDL entity called `ComplexDesign` with input and output ports for clock, reset, data input, operation selection, and result.

2. The `Behavioral` architecture contains the implementation of the design.

3. It declares internal signals for the state machine, temporary storage of data, and the result.

4. A state machine is implemented using a `process` that transitions between states based on the input `operation_select` and `clk`.

5. The state machine handles the selection of operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide), and stores the data accordingly.

6. The result is calculated based on the state and intermediate data using another `process`.

7. The `case` statements handle the different states and operations.

8. The final result is output through the `result` port.

This code showcases a complex and differentiated design involving a state machine, data manipulation, and result calculation.
