Explanation:

- The `ComplexSystem` entity defines the interface of the system, including input and output ports.
- The `Behavioral` architecture defines the implementation of the system using a state machine and various internal signals and variables.
- The state machine has three states: "00" (initial state), "01" (processing state), and any other state (invalid state).
- In the initial state, the system waits for the `start` signal to start processing.
- In the processing state, the system accumulates input data, performs complex calculations on it, and shifts the results to the output.
- The `done` signal is asserted when processing is complete, and the system returns to the initial state.
- This code is complex and differentiated because it combines various functionalities and features, including data accumulation, complex calculations, and state machine control. It is designed to be comprehensive and comprehensive, covering a wide range of operations and scenarios.
