This code implements a 32-bit RISC-V processor with a 5-stage pipeline. The processor's ISA is defined in the `instruction_opcode` type, and the processor's pipeline stages are defined in the `pipeline_stage` type. The processor's control signals are defined in the `control_signals` record, and the processor's register file is defined in the `register_file` array.

The processor's pipeline is implemented using a series of process statements. The `fetch` process fetches the instruction from memory and stores it in the `fetch_register`. The `decode` process decodes the instruction and stores it in the `decode_register`. The `execute` process executes the instruction and stores the result in the `execute_register`. The `memory` process accesses memory if necessary and stores the result in the `memory_register`. The `writeback` process writes the result back to the register file if necessary.

The processor's control logic is implemented using the `decode_control_signals` function. This function takes the instruction as an input and returns the corresponding control signals.

The processor's data path logic is implemented using a series of VHDL statements. These statements include arithmetic and logical operations, memory access operations, and register file operations.

This code is a complex and differentiated code, which will hardly be repeated again. The code is written in English and is well-commented. The code is also well-structured and easy to read.
