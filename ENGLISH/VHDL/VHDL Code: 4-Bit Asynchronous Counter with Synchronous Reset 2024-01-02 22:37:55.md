Certainly! Here's a complex and differentiated VHDL code that implements a 4-bit asynchronous counter with a synchronous reset. Let me explain the code step by step:

```vhdl
-- Entity declaration
entity Asynchronous_Counter is
    port (
        clock   : in  std_logic;
        reset   : in  std_logic;
        enable  : in  std_logic;
        q       : out std_logic_vector(3 downto 0)
    );
end entity Asynchronous_Counter;
```

- We start by declaring the entity `Asynchronous_Counter`. The entity has four ports:
  - `clock` is an input representing the clock signal.
  - `reset` is an input representing the synchronous reset signal.
  - `enable` is an input representing the enable signal.
  - `q` is a 4-bit output representing the counter value.

```vhdl
-- Architecture definition
architecture Behavioral of Asynchronous_Counter is
    signal counter : unsigned(3 downto 0);
begin
    process(clock, reset)
    begin
        if reset = '1' then
            counter <= (others => '0');  -- Reset counter to all zeros
        elsif rising_edge(clock) then
            if enable = '1' then
                counter <= counter + 1;  -- Increment counter by 1
            end if;
        end if;
    end process;

    q <= std_logic_vector(counter);  -- Convert counter to std_logic_vector
end architecture Behavioral;
```

- The architecture `Behavioral` defines the behavior of the entity. It contains one process, which is sensitive to changes in `clock` and `reset`.
- Inside the process, we check if `reset` is asserted. If true, we reset the `counter` to all zeros.
- We also check if a rising edge of `clock` occurs while `enable` is asserted. If true, we increment the `counter` by 1.
- Finally, we assign the value of `counter` to the output `q` after converting it to `std_logic_vector`.

This VHDL code implements a 4-bit asynchronous counter with a synchronous reset. The counter increments by 1 on each rising edge of the clock when the enable signal is asserted. When the reset signal is asserted, the counter is reset to all zeros. The current counter value is output through the `q` port as a 4-bit binary representation.
