This code is a very large and differentiated code, which will hardly be repeated again. The code is in English and explains itself in detail.

The code starts by defining some variables, then it prints the values of the variables.

Next, the code creates a function and calls it.

Then, the code creates a loop and a conditional statement.

Finally, the code creates a case statement and exits the script.
