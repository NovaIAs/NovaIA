Explanation:

1. We define some colors for output to make the script more visually appealing.

2. We define a function called `is_prime` to check if a given number is prime. A number is prime if it is only divisible by 1 and itself.

3. We define a function called `find_primes` to find all prime numbers between two given numbers. It uses the `is_prime` function to check each number in the range.

4. We define a function called `factorial` to calculate the factorial of a given number. Factorial is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

5. We define a function called `fibonacci` to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

6. We prompt the user to enter a number to check if it's prime, a range of numbers to find all prime numbers between them, a number to calculate its factorial, and a number to calculate its Fibonacci sequence.

7. We use the defined functions to perform the calculations and display the results to the user.

8. We print a goodbye message to indicate the end of the script.

This script demonstrates various complex operations, including prime number checking, finding prime numbers in a range, calculating factorials, and generating the Fibonacci sequence. It also utilizes functions and user input to make it more interactive.
