```shell
#!/bin/bash

# This script is a complex and differentiated code that will hardly be repeated again.
# It is written in English and is designed to be easy to understand and use.

# The script starts by defining some variables.
# The variable "input_file" is the name of the file that contains the data to be processed.
# The variable "output_file" is the name of the file that will contain the processed data.
# The variable "delimiter" is the character that separates the fields in the input file.
# The variable "header" is a flag that indicates whether or not the input file contains a header row.

input_file="data.csv"
output_file="processed_data.csv"
delimiter=","
header=true

# The script then uses a "while" loop to read each line of the input file.
# The variable "line" is used to store the current line being read.
# The variable "fields" is used to store the fields in the current line.

while IFS=$delimiter read -r line; do
  # If the header flag is true, the first line of the input file is skipped.
  if [ $header = true ]; then
    header=false
    continue
  fi

  # The current line is split into fields using the delimiter.
  fields=($line)

  # The fields in the current line are then processed.
  # In this example, the script simply prints the fields to the standard output.

  for field in "${fields[@]}"; do
    echo "$field"
  done
done < $input_file > $output_file

# The script ends by printing a message to the standard output to indicate that the processing is complete.

echo "Processing complete."
```

**Explanation:**

* The first line of the script (``#!/bin/bash``) specifies the shell that should be used to interpret the script.
* The next few lines define variables that are used in the script.
* The ``while`` loop is used to read each line of the input file.
* The ``if`` statement is used to skip the first line of the input file if it contains a header row.
* The ``fields=($line)`` line splits the current line into fields using the delimiter.
* The ``for`` loop is used to process each field in the current line.
* The ``echo`` command is used to print the fields to the standard output.
* The ``done < $input_file > $output_file`` line redirects the standard input and output of the script to the input file and output file, respectively.
* The ``echo "Processing complete."`` line prints a message to the standard output to indicate that the processing is complete.
