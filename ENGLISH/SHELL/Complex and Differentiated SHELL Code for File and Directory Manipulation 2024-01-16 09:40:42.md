**Explanation:**

This script is a complex and differentiated SHELL code that performs a variety of tasks, including:

* Printing messages in different colors
* Listing the files and directories in a directory
* Creating a new directory
* Changing the current directory
* Creating a new file
* Writing text to a file
* Printing the contents of a file
* Deleting a file
* Changing the current directory back to the original directory

The script uses a variety of SHELL commands, including:

* `pwd` to print the current directory
* `ls` to list the files and directories in a directory
* `mkdir` to create a new directory
* `cd` to change the current directory
* `touch` to create a new file
* `echo` to write text to a file
* `cat` to print the contents of a file
* `rm` to delete a file

The script also uses a variety of variables, including:

* `current_directory` to store the current directory
* `new_directory` to store the name of the new directory
* `file1.txt` to store the name of the new file

The script is well-commented and easy to understand. It is a good example of how to use SHELL commands to perform complex tasks.
