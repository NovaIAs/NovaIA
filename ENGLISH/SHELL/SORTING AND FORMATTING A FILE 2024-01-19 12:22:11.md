# It is written in English and it is explained in detail below.

# The script starts by defining some variables.
# The variable `input_file` is the path to the input file.
# The variable `output_file` is the path to the output file.
# The variable `delimiter` is the delimiter that is used to separate the fields in the input file.
# The variable `sort_field` is the field that the input file should be sorted by.
# The variable `sort_order` is the order in which the input file should be sorted (ascending or descending).

# The script then sorts the input file by the specified field and order.
# The `sort` command is used to sort the file.
# The `-t` option specifies the delimiter that is used to separate the fields in the file.
# The `-k` option specifies the field that the file should be sorted by.
# The `-r` option reverses the order of the sort.

# Explanation of the code:

The script starts by defining some variables.
The variable `input_file` is the path to the input file.
The variable `output_file` is the path to the output file.
The variable `delimiter` is the delimiter that is used to separate the fields in the input file.
The variable `sort_field` is the field that the input file should be sorted by.
The variable `sort_order` is the order in which the input file should be sorted (ascending or descending).

The script then checks if the input file exists.
If it does not exist, the script prints an error message and exits.

The script then sorts the input file by the specified field and order.
The `sort` command is used to sort the file.
The `-t` option specifies the delimiter that is used to separate the fields in the file.
The `-k` option specifies the field that the file should be sorted by.
The `-r` option reverses the order of the sort.

The script then reads the sorted input file line by line.
For each line, the script splits the line into fields using the specified delimiter.
The script then writes the fields to the output file, separated by a comma.

The script then removes the temporary file.

The script then prints a message to the user to indicate that the script has completed successfully.

The script then exits.
