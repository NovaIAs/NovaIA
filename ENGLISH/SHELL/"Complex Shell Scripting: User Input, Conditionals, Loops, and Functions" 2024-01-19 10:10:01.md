# This script is a complex example of shell scripting. It demonstrates the use of variables, conditionals, loops, and functions.

# Define some variables.

age=30
city="New York City"

# Check if the user has provided a name.
if [ -z "$name" ]; then
  echo "Please provide a name."
  exit 1

# Check if the user has provided an age.

  echo "Please provide an age."
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the user has provided a city.
if [ -z "$city" ]; then
  echo "Please provide a city."
  exit 1
fi

# Print a greeting to the user.
echo "Hello, $name!"

# Print the user's age.
echo "You are $age years old."

# Print the user's city.
echo "You live in $city."

# Define a function to calculate the user's retirement age.
retirement_age() {
  local age=$1
  local years_to_retirement=65
  local retirement_age=$((age + years_to_retirement))
  echo $retirement_age
}

# Calculate the user's retirement age.
retirement_age $age

# Print the user's retirement age.
echo "Your retirement age is $retirement_age."
```

**Explanation:**

* The script first defines some variables, including the user's name, age, and city.
* The script then checks if the user has provided all of the required information. If not, the script prints an error message and exits.
* The script then prints a greeting to the user, along with their age and city.
* The script then defines a function to calculate the user's retirement age. The function takes the user's age as an argument and returns the user's retirement age.
* The script then calls the function to calculate the user's retirement age and prints the result.

This script is a complex example of shell scripting, but it demonstrates the use of variables, conditionals, loops, and functions.
