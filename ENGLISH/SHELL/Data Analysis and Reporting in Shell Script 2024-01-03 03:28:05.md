Certainly! Here's a complex and differentiated code in Shell scripting:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# This shell script is designed to perform a series of tasks related to data analysis.

# Step 1: Check if the required dependencies are installed
command -v python3 >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo >&2 "Python 3 is required but it's not installed. Aborting."; exit 1; }
command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo >&2 "jq is required but it's not installed. Aborting."; exit 1; }

# Step 2: Set up variables
data_file="data.csv"
output_dir="results"
log_file="log.txt"

# Step 3: Create output directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$output_dir"

# Step 4: Pre-process the data
python3 preprocess.py "$data_file" "$output_dir/preprocessed_data.csv" >> "$log_file"

# Step 5: Perform data analysis
echo "Performing data analysis..."
python3 analyze.py "$output_dir/preprocessed_data.csv" >> "$log_file"

# Step 6: Generate visualizations
echo "Generating visualizations..."
python3 visualize.py "$output_dir/preprocessed_data.csv" "$output_dir/visualizations" >> "$log_file"

# Step 7: Generate summary report
echo "Generating summary report..."
python3 generate_report.py "$output_dir/preprocessed_data.csv" "$output_dir/visualizations" "$output_dir/summary_report.pdf" >> "$log_file"

# Step 8: Clean up temporary files
rm "$output_dir/preprocessed_data.csv"

# Step 9: Done!
echo "Data analysis and reporting completed. Results can be found in the '$output_dir' directory."
```

Explanation:
This Shell script is designed to perform a series of tasks related to data analysis. Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. Checks if the required dependencies (Python 3 and jq) are installed on the system.
2. Sets up variables such as the input data file, output directory, and log file.
3. Creates the output directory if it does not exist.
4. Executes a Python script (`preprocess.py`) to preprocess the data and save it as `preprocessed_data.csv` in the output directory. The script's output is redirected to the log file.
5. Performs data analysis using another Python script (`analyze.py`). The script reads the preprocessed data and performs the analysis. The output is appended to the log file.
6. Generates visualizations using a third Python script (`visualize.py`). The script reads the preprocessed data and generates visualizations in the `visualizations` subdirectory of the output directory. The output is appended to the log file.
7. Generates a summary report using a fourth Python script (`generate_report.py`). The script reads the preprocessed data and the visualizations and generates a PDF report named `summary_report.pdf` in the output directory. The output is appended to the log file.
8. Removes the temporary preprocessed data file.
9. Displays a completion message with the location of the results.

Note: You would need to replace the placeholder Python script names (`preprocess.py`, `analyze.py`, `visualize.py`, and `generate_report.py`) with actual scripts that perform the respective tasks.
