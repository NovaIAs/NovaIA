Explanation:

The script starts by defining a function called `calculate_area()`. This function takes two parameters: `length` and `width`. It calculates the area of the rectangle using the formula `area = length * width`.

The script then defines a function called `print_area()`. This function takes two parameters: `area` and `shape`. It prints the area of the rectangle, along with the shape of the rectangle.

The script then defines a function called `main()`. This function is the entry point for the script. It gets the length and width of the rectangle from the user, calculates the area of the rectangle, and then prints the area of the rectangle.

The script then calls the `main()` function to start the script.
