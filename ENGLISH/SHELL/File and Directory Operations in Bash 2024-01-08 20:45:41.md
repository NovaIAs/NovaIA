This code is a collection of functions that perform various file and directory operations. It includes functions to create, delete, copy, move, rename, search, and list files and directories, as well as a function to print the current working directory and a function to exit the shell.

The code is designed to be modular and reusable, with each function performing a specific task. This makes it easy to add new functions or modify existing ones as needed.

The code also includes a help function that displays a list of all the available commands and their usage. This makes it easy for users to learn how to use the code.

To use the code, simply call the desired function with the appropriate arguments. For example, to create a directory called "my_directory", you would use the following command:

```
create_directory my_directory
```

To delete a directory called "my_directory", you would use the following command:

```
delete_directory my_directory
```

To copy a file called "file1.txt" to a file called "file2.txt", you would use the following command:

```
copy_file file1.txt file2.txt
```

To move a file called "file1.txt" to a file called "file2.txt", you would use the following command:

```
move_file file1.txt file2.txt
```

To rename a file called "file1.txt" to a file called "file2.txt", you would use the following command:

```
rename_file file1.txt file2.txt
```

To search for all files that match the pattern "*.txt", you would use the following command:

```
search_file *.txt
```

To list all files in the current directory, you would use the following command:

```
list_files
```

To print the current working directory, you would use the following command:

```
print_cwd
```

To exit the shell, you would use the following command:

```
exit_shell
```
