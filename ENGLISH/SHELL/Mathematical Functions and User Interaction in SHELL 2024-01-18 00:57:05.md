Explanation:

1. Factorial Function:

   - The `factorial()` function calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.
   - It recursively multiplies the number by the factorial of the previous number until it reaches 1.

2. Prime Number Check:

   - The `is_prime()` function checks if a given number is prime.
   - It does this by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if any of these numbers divide the given number evenly.

3. Fibonacci Sequence Generator:

   - The `fibonacci()` function generates Fibonacci numbers using a recursive approach.
   - It starts with the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1) and then generates subsequent numbers by adding the previous two numbers.

4. User Interaction:

   - The script prompts the user to enter numbers for factorial calculation, prime number check, and Fibonacci number generation.

5. Output:

   - The script displays the factorial, prime number check result, and Fibonacci sequence based on the user's input.

This code demonstrates various mathematical functions, recursion, user interaction, and looping constructs in SHELL, making it a relatively complex and differentiated code. It can be used as a starting point for creating more intricate and sophisticated scripts.
