Explanation:

* The script starts by defining the input and output directories.
* It then creates the output directory if it does not exist.
* The script then loops over all files in the input directory.
* For each file, it performs the following operations:
    * Converts the file to lowercase and saves it to a new file in the output directory.
    * Converts the file to uppercase and saves it to a new file in the output directory.
    * Removes all punctuation from the file and saves it to a new file in the output directory.
    * Removes all whitespace from the file and saves it to a new file in the output directory.
    * Counts the number of words in the file and saves the result to a new file in the output directory.
    * Counts the number of lines in the file and saves the result to a new file in the output directory.
    * Counts the number of characters in the file and saves the result to a new file in the output directory.
* Finally, the script prints a success message.
