Explanation:

* The first line defines the main target of the makefile, which is to build all the components of the software system.
* The next three lines define the rules for building each component. Each rule consists of two commands: one to compile the source code and one to link the object files into a static library.
* The next line defines the rule for cleaning up the build artifacts, which consists of removing the object files and static libraries for all the components.
* The next line defines the rule for displaying help information, which consists of displaying a message explaining the usage of the makefile.
* The last line defines the default target, which is to build all the components of the software system.

This makefile is complex and differentiated because it builds a software system consisting of multiple components, each of which is built using its own set of rules. The makefile also includes a rule for cleaning up the build artifacts and a rule for displaying help information.
