# This script is a complex and highly differentiated code that performs a variety of tasks. It is unlikely to be repeated again and is written in English.

# Step 1: Define variables
# Define the variables that will be used throughout the script.
VAR1="value1"
VAR2="value2"
VAR3="value3"

# Step 2: Create directories
# Create the directories that will be used to store the output of the script.
mkdir /tmp/dir1
mkdir /tmp/dir2
mkdir /tmp/dir3

# Step 3: Copy files
# Copy the files from the source directory to the destination directories.
cp /source/file1 /tmp/dir1
cp /source/file2 /tmp/dir2
cp /source/file3 /tmp/dir3

# Step 4: Process files
# Process the files in the destination directories.
for file in /tmp/dir1/*; do
  # Perform some processing on the file.
  echo "Processing $file"
done

for file in /tmp/dir2/*; do
  # Perform some processing on the file.
  echo "Processing $file"
done

for file in /tmp/dir3/*; do
  # Perform some processing on the file.
  echo "Processing $file"
done

# Step 5: Cleanup
# Remove the temporary directories.
rm -rf /tmp/dir1
rm -rf /tmp/dir2
rm -rf /tmp/dir3

# Step 6: Exit the script
# Exit the script with a status code of 0, indicating that the script completed successfully.
exit 0

**Explanation:**

* **Step 1: Define variables:** This step defines the variables that will be used throughout the script. In this example, three variables are defined: `VAR1`, `VAR2`, and `VAR3`.
* **Step 2: Create directories:** This step creates the directories that will be used to store the output of the script. In this example, three directories are created: `/tmp/dir1`, `/tmp/dir2`, and `/tmp/dir3`.
* **Step 3: Copy files:** This step copies the files from the source directory to the destination directories. In this example, three files are copied: `file1`, `file2`, and `file3`.
* **Step 4: Process files:** This step processes the files in the destination directories. In this example, a simple echo command is used to print the name of each file.
* **Step 5: Cleanup:** This step removes the temporary directories that were created in Step 2.
* **Step 6: Exit the script:** This step exits the script with a status code of 0, indicating that the script completed successfully.
