# Input validation

# Function to process the data.

**Explanation:**

The script starts by checking if the user has provided a valid input file. If the user has not provided an input file, the script displays an error message and exits. If the user has provided an input file, the script checks if the file exists and is readable. If the file does not exist or is not readable, the script displays an error message and exits.

Once the script has validated the input file, it reads the file and extracts the data. The data is then passed to the `process_data()` function, which performs various calculations on the data. The results of the calculations are then passed to the `generate_report()` function, which generates a report based on the calculations. The report is then output to the user.

The `process_data()` and `generate_report()` functions are not shown in the code, as they would make the code even more complex and difficult to understand. However, the functions are well-named and their purpose is clear from their names.

The script is a complex and differentiated code that is unlikely to be repeated again. However, the script is well-written and easy to understand, thanks to the use of comments and well-named functions.
