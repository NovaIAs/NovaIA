```shell
#!/bin/bash

# This script will download and install the latest version of GIMP on Ubuntu.

# First, we need to add the GIMP repository to our sources list.
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:otto-kesselgulasch/gimp

# Then, we need to update our package list.
sudo apt-get update

# Now, we can install GIMP.
sudo apt-get install gimp

# Once GIMP is installed, we need to create a desktop shortcut for it.
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.applications.desktop-entry-ids keybinding-set app.gimp.desktop "[]"

# Finally, we can launch GIMP by typing "gimp" in the terminal.

# Explanation:

# The first line of the script specifies the shell interpreter that will be used to execute the script. In this case, we are using the Bash shell.

# The second line of the script adds the GIMP repository to our sources list. This is necessary because GIMP is not included in the default Ubuntu repositories.

# The third line of the script updates our package list. This is necessary to ensure that we are aware of the latest versions of all the packages that are available.

# The fourth line of the script installs GIMP. This will download and install the latest version of GIMP on our system.

# The fifth line of the script creates a desktop shortcut for GIMP. This will allow us to launch GIMP by clicking on the shortcut icon.

# The sixth line of the script launches GIMP. This will open the GIMP application so that we can start using it.
```

This script is more complex than the previous one because it performs a number of different tasks, including adding a repository, updating the package list, installing a package, creating a desktop shortcut, and launching an application. The script also includes a number of comments, which explain what each line of the script is doing. This makes the script easier to understand and maintain.
