# This script is a complex and differentiated code that will hardly be repeated again.

# It performs the following tasks:
# 1. Checks if the user is running the script as root.
# 2. Creates a temporary directory.
# 3. Downloads a file from the internet.
# 4. Extracts the contents of the downloaded file.
# 5. Compiles the extracted source code.
# 6. Installs the compiled software.
# 7. Removes the temporary directory.

# Check if the user is running the script as root.

if [ "$(id -u)" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "This script must be run as root."
  exit 1
fi

# Create a temporary directory.

tempdir=$(mktemp -d)

# Download a file from the internet.

wget -O "$tempdir/file.tar.gz" "https://example.com/file.tar.gz"

# Extract the contents of the downloaded file.

tar -xzf "$tempdir/file.tar.gz" -C "$tempdir"

# Compile the extracted source code.

cd "$tempdir/file"
make

# Install the compiled software.

make install

# Remove the temporary directory.

rm -rf "$tempdir"

# The script is now complete.
```

**Explanation:**

1. The `#!/bin/bash` line tells the operating system that this script is a bash script.
2. The `if [ "$(id -u)" -ne 0 ]; then` line checks if the user is running the script as root. If the user is not root, the script will exit with an error message.
3. The `tempdir=$(mktemp -d)` line creates a temporary directory.
4. The `wget -O "$tempdir/file.tar.gz" "https://example.com/file.tar.gz"` line downloads a file from the internet and saves it to the temporary directory.
5. The `tar -xzf "$tempdir/file.tar.gz" -C "$tempdir"` line extracts the contents of the downloaded file to the temporary directory.
6. The `cd "$tempdir/file"` line changes the current directory to the directory where the extracted source code is located.
7. The `make` line compiles the extracted source code.
8. The `make install` line installs the compiled software.
9. The `rm -rf "$tempdir"` line removes the temporary directory.
