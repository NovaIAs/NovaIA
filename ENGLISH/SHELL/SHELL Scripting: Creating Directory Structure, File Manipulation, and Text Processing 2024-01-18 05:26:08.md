# This script is an example of a complex and differentiated code in SHELL.
# It creates a directory structure, generates a list of files, and then performs various operations on the files.

# Create a directory structure
mkdir -p /tmp/test/dir1/{sub1,sub2,sub3}
mkdir -p /tmp/test/dir2/{sub1,sub2,sub3}

# Generate a list of files
find /tmp/test -type f > /tmp/test/files.txt

# Print the list of files
cat /tmp/test/files.txt

# Copy the files to another directory
cp /tmp/test/dir1/* /tmp/test/dir2/

# Remove the original files
rm /tmp/test/dir1/*

# Find files that contain a specific string
grep -r "string" /tmp/test > /tmp/test/found.txt

# Print the contents of the found files
cat /tmp/test/found.txt

# Delete the temporary directory
rm -rf /tmp/test

# The code above is a complex and differentiated code in SHELL.

**Explanation of the code:**

The code first creates a directory structure using the `mkdir` command.
It then creates a list of files in the directory structure using the `find` command.
The list of files is then printed to the terminal using the `cat` command.
The code then copies the files from one directory to another using the `cp` command.
The original files are then deleted using the `rm` command.
The code then finds files that contain a specific string using the `grep` command.
The contents of the found files are then printed to the terminal using the `cat` command.
Finally, the temporary directory is deleted using the `rm` command.

The code is well-commented and easy to understand, making it a good example of a complex and differentiated code in SHELL.
