Explanation:

* The script starts by declaring a number of variables, including the paths to the source code and binary directories, the compiler executable, the compiler flags, the list of source code files, and the name of the executable file to generate.
* It then defines two functions: `compile_source_file()` and `link_object_files()`.
* The `compile_source_file()` function takes a source code file name as an argument and compiles it using the specified compiler flags, placing the resulting object file in the BIN_DIR directory.
* The `link_object_files()` function takes a list of object files as arguments and links them into an executable file, placing the resulting executable file in the BIN_DIR directory.
* The main logic of the script then consists of a loop that iterates over the list of source code files, calling the `compile_source_file()` function on each one.
* After the loop is complete, the `link_object_files()` function is called to link the object files into an executable file.
* Finally, a message is printed to indicate that the compilation and linking process is complete.
