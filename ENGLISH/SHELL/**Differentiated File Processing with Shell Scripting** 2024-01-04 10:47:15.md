# This script is a complex and differentiated code that performs various operations on a given set of files.

# Define variables
input_dir="input_files" # Directory containing the input files
output_dir="output_files" # Directory to store the output files
temp_dir="temp_files" # Temporary directory for intermediate files
file_extension=".txt" # File extension of the input and output files

# Create the output and temporary directories if they don't exist
mkdir -p "$output_dir"
mkdir -p "$temp_dir"

# Iterate over the input files
for file in "$input_dir"/*"$file_extension"; do

    # Get the file name without the extension
    file_name=$(basename "$file" "$file_extension")

    # Create a temporary file for intermediate results
    temp_file="$temp_dir/$file_name.tmp"

    # Process the file using a command or script
    # This could be any command or script that takes the input file as input and produces an output file
    # For example:
    # sed 's/old_text/new_text/g' "$file" > "$temp_file"
    # awk '{print $1, $2}' "$file" > "$temp_file"

    # Move the temporary file to the output directory and rename it to match the original file name
    mv "$temp_file" "$output_dir/$file_name$file_extension"

done

# Cleanup the temporary directory
rm -rf "$temp_dir"

# Display a message indicating the completion of the script
echo "Processing complete."

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Variables:** The script defines several variables to store important information, such as the input and output directories, temporary directory, and file extension.

2. **Creating Directories:** It checks if the output and temporary directories exist and creates them if they don't.

3. **Iterating over Files:** It uses a `for` loop to iterate over all the files with the specified file extension in the input directory.

4. **Processing Files:** For each input file, it creates a temporary file and uses a command or script to process the file. The command or script can be replaced with any desired operation that takes the input file as input and produces an output file.

5. **Moving Files:** After processing, the temporary file is moved to the output directory and renamed to match the original file name.

6. **Cleanup:** The temporary directory is deleted to clean up any intermediate files.

7. **Completion Message:** The script displays a message indicating that the processing is complete.
