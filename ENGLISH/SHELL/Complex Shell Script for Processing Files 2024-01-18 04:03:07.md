```shell
#!/bin/sh

# This is a complex shell script that performs a variety of tasks.

# First, it checks to see if the user has provided a filename as an argument.
# If no filename is provided, the script prints an error message and exits.

if [ $# -eq 0 ]
then
  echo "Usage: $0 filename"
  exit 1
fi

# Next, the script checks to see if the file exists.
# If the file does not exist, the script prints an error message and exits.

if [ ! -f "$1" ]
then
  echo "Error: file $1 does not exist."
  exit 1
fi

# Now that we know that the file exists, we can start processing it.

# First, we create a temporary directory.
# This directory will be used to store intermediate files.

tmpdir=$(mktemp -d)

# Next, we copy the input file to the temporary directory.

cp "$1" "$tmpdir/input.txt"

# Now we can start processing the file.

# First, we use the grep command to search for all lines that contain the word "error".
# We then use the sed command to replace all occurrences of the word "error" with the word "warning".

grep error "$tmpdir/input.txt" | sed -e 's/error/warning/g' > "$tmpdir/output.txt"

# Next, we use the awk command to count the number of lines in the output file.

num_errors=$(awk '{print NR}' "$tmpdir/output.txt" | wc -l)

# Now we can print a summary of the results.

echo "Found $num_errors errors in file $1."

# Finally, we clean up by deleting the temporary directory.

rm -rf "$tmpdir"
```

This script is complex because it performs a variety of tasks, including:

* Checking for the presence of a filename argument
* Checking for the existence of the file
* Creating a temporary directory
* Copying the input file to the temporary directory
* Processing the file using grep, sed, and awk
* Printing a summary of the results
* Cleaning up by deleting the temporary directory

The script is also differentiated because it uses a variety of shell commands and features, including:

* The `if` statement
* The `[ ]` test command
* The `cp` command
* The `grep` command
* The `sed` command
* The `awk` command
* The `wc` command
* The `rm` command
* The `-d` option
* The `-f` option
* The `-g` option
* The `-l` option
* The `-r` option
* The `-s` option

This script is an example of how complex tasks can be performed in a shell script.
