# Join the lines in the temporary file into a single line, separated by the delimiter.
joined_line=$(paste -sd "$delimiter" "$temp_file")

# Write the joined line to the output file.
printf "%s\n" "$joined_line" > "$output_file"

Explanation:

* The script starts by defining some variables, including the input file, output file, temporary file, and delimiter.
* The `while` loop is used to read the lines from the input file and store them in an array called `input_array`.
* The `sort` command is used to sort the array in ascending order.
* The `printf` command is used to write the sorted array to a temporary file called `temp.file`.
* The `paste` command is used to join the lines in the temporary file into a single line, separated by the delimiter.
* The `printf` command is used to write the joined line to the output file called `output.file`.
* The `rm` command is used to remove the temporary file.
* The `echo` command is used to print a success message.
* The `exit` command is used to exit the script with a status code of 0, indicating success.
