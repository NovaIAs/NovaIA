# This script is a complex and differentiated code in SHELL that is unlikely to be repeated again.
# It is designed to demonstrate the power and flexibility of the SHELL programming language.

# The script begins by defining a few variables.
# The first variable, `input_file`, is the name of the input file that will be processed by the script.
# The second variable, `output_file`, is the name of the output file that will be generated by the script.
# The third variable, `delimiter`, is the character that will be used to separate the fields in the input file.
# The fourth variable, `header`, is a flag that indicates whether or not the input file has a header row.
input_file="input.csv"
output_file="output.csv"
delimiter=","
header=true

# The script then uses the `awk` command to process the input file.
# The `awk` command is a powerful text processing tool that can be used to extract specific fields from a file, perform calculations on those fields, and generate output in a variety of formats.
# In this case, the `awk` command is used to extract the first three fields from each line of the input file and write them to the output file.
# The `-F` option specifies the delimiter that will be used to separate the fields in the input file.
# The `-v` option allows us to pass variables to the `awk` command.
# In this case, we are passing the `header` variable to the `awk` command.
awk -F"$delimiter" -v header="$header" '{ if (header) { header = false; next } print $1, $2, $3 }' "$input_file" > "$output_file"

# The script then uses the `sort` command to sort the output file by the first field.
# The `-k` option specifies the field that will be used to sort the file.
# In this case, we are sorting the file by the first field.
sort -k1 "$output_file" > "$output_file.sorted"

# The script then uses the `uniq` command to remove any duplicate lines from the sorted output file.
# The `-u` option specifies that we want to remove duplicate lines.
uniq "$output_file.sorted" > "$output_file.uniq"

# The script then uses the `sed` command to remove the header row from the uniq output file.
# The `-i` option specifies that we want to edit the file in place.
# The `1d` command deletes the first line of the file.
sed -i '1d' "$output_file.uniq"

# The script then uses the `wc -l` command to count the number of lines in the uniq output file.
# The `-l` option specifies that we want to count the number of lines in the file.
num_lines=$(wc -l "$output_file.uniq")

# The script then uses the `echo` command to print the number of lines in the uniq output file to the console.
echo "The number of lines in the uniq output file is: $num_lines"

# The script then exits with a status code of 0, indicating that it ran successfully.
exit 0

This script is a complex and differentiated code in SHELL that is unlikely to be repeated again. It demonstrates the power and flexibility of the SHELL programming language. The script uses a variety of SHELL commands, including `awk`, `sort`, `uniq`, `sed`, and `wc`, to process a CSV file and generate a variety of output files. The script is well-commented and easy to understand.
