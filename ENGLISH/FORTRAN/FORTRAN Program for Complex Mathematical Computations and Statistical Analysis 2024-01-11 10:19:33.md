Explanation:

This code performs a complex mathematical computation on a large array of data. It calculates the sine, cosine, and tangent of each element in the array, and then performs statistical analysis on the results.

The code is written in FORTRAN, a programming language that is commonly used for scientific computing. FORTRAN is known for its speed and efficiency, making it a good choice for this type of computation.

The code is divided into several sections:

* **Variable Declarations:** This section declares the variables that will be used in the program. The `implicit none` statement ensures that all variables must be explicitly declared before they can be used.
* **Data Calculation:** This section calculates the sine, cosine, and tangent of each element in the `x` array. The results are stored in the `y` and `z` arrays, respectively.
* **Statistical Analysis:** This section performs statistical analysis on the data in the `x`, `y`, and `z` arrays. The mean and standard deviation of each array is calculated and printed to the console.

The code is complex and requires a good understanding of FORTRAN to understand fully. However, it is a good example of how FORTRAN can be used to perform complex scientific computations.
