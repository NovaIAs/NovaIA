This code is a complex FORTRAN program that performs a series of calculations and prints the results. The code is written in English and is well-commented, making it easy to understand and follow.

The code first declares a number of variables, including integers, real numbers, and a character string. The variables are then initialized with values.

The code then performs a series of calculations on the variables. For example, it adds the values of x and y, subtracts the value of z from the value of y, and multiplies the value of z by 2.

The code then prints the new values of the variables.

Finally, the code terminates the program.
