This program analyzes a very large number. It first gets the number from the user. Then, it analyzes the number to see if it is even or odd, divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, or 17, and what its square root, natural logarithm, exponential, sine, cosine, and tangent are. Finally, it prints out the results of the analysis.

The program uses a variety of FOR
