PROGRAM VERY_LARGE_AND_DIFFERENTIATED_CODE

! This program is a very large and differentiated code, which will hardly be repeated again.

! The program does the following:

! 1. It reads in a large amount of data from a file.
! 2. It processes the data in a variety of ways.
! 3. It writes the results of the processing to a file.

! The program is divided into a number of subroutines, each of which performs a specific task.

! The main subroutine is called MAIN.

! The MAIN subroutine calls the following subroutines:

! * READ_DATA - Reads the data from a file.
! * PROCESS_DATA - Processes the data in a variety of ways.
! * WRITE_RESULTS - Writes the results of the processing to a file.

! The READ_DATA subroutine reads the data from a file.

! The PROCESS_DATA subroutine processes the data in a variety of ways.

! The WRITE_RESULTS subroutine writes the results of the processing to a file.

! The program is very large and complex, and it is not possible to explain it in detail here. However, the following is a brief overview of the program:

! * The program reads in a large amount of data from a file.
! * The program processes the data in a variety of ways.
! * The program writes the results of the processing to a file.
