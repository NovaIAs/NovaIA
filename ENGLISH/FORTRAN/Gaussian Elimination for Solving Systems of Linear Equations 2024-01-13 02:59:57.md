This code solves a system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination. The system of equations is represented by the coefficient matrix A and the right-hand side vector b. The solution vector x is computed by performing Gaussian elimination on A and b.

The code first reads the input data from the file input.dat. The coefficient matrix A and the right-hand side vector b are stored in two-dimensional and one-dimensional arrays, respectively.

The code then performs Gaussian elimination on A and b. Gaussian elimination is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations by systematically eliminating the unknowns one at a time. The algorithm works by repeatedly finding the pivot row, which is the row with the largest absolute value in the current column, and then subtracting multiples of the pivot row from the other rows in the matrix. This process is repeated until the matrix is in upper triangular form, meaning that all the elements below the diagonal are zero.

Once the matrix is in upper triangular form, the solution vector x can be computed by back substitution. Back substitution is a simple algorithm for solving triangular systems of equations. The algorithm starts by solving the last equation in the system for the last unknown. Once the last unknown is known, the next-to-last equation can be solved for the next-to-last unknown, and so on.

The code finally prints the solution vector x to the file output.dat.
