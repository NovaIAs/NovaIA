This code is a complex Fortran program that generates some random data, calculates some statistics on the data, and then prints out the results. The code is complex because it uses a number of different Fortran features, including:

* Arrays: The code uses arrays to store the data.
* Loops: The code uses loops to generate the data and calculate the statistics.
* Functions: The code uses the `sum`, `sqrt`, `minval`, and `maxval` functions to calculate the statistics.
* Input and output: The code uses the `print` statement to print out the results.

The code is also complex because it is very large. It has over 100 lines of code. This makes it difficult to read and understand.

Here is a brief explanation of the code:

* The first few lines of the code declare some variables. These variables are used to store the data and the statistics.
* The next few lines of the code generate some random data. The `random_number` function is used to generate the random numbers.
* The next few lines of the code calculate some statistics on the data. The `sum` function is used to calculate the mean values. The `sqrt` function is used to calculate the standard deviations. The `minval` and `maxval` functions are used to calculate the minimum and maximum values.
* The last few lines of the code print out the results. The `print` statement is used to print out the results.

This code is a good example of a complex Fortran program. It uses a number of different Fortran features and it is very large. This makes it difficult to read and understand. However, the code is well-commented and it is easy to follow the flow of the code.
