Here is a complex and differentiated code in FORTRAN that will hardly be repeated again:

```
MODULE MACHINE
Implicit None
Integer, Parameter :: DP = SELECTED_REAL_KIND(p=13)
End Module MACHINE

PROGRAM DIFF_CODE
Implicit None
Use MACHINE
Integer, Dimension(DP) :: A, B, C

Do i = 1, DP
  A(i) = i
  B(i) = 2 * i
End Do

Where(A<1) = B(A<1)

End PROGRAM DIFF_CODE
```

This code is a Fortran program that generates two arrays of integers, A and B, each having a length of 13. The array A is filled with values from 1 to 13, while the array B is filled with values from 2 to 26.

The code then uses a WHERE statement to replace all the values in the array A that are less than 1 with the corresponding values from the array B. This is done using the expression WHERE(A<1) = B(A<1).

This code is complex and differentiated because it uses a number of advanced Fortran features, including:

* The use of the MODULE statement to define a module that contains a parameter for the precision of the floating-point data type to be used in the program.
* The use of the SELECTED_REAL_KIND intrinsic function to select the appropriate floating-point data type for the program.
* The use of the DP parameter to specify the length of the arrays A, B, and C.
* The use of the DO loop to fill the arrays A and B with data.
* The use of the WHERE statement to replace the values in the array A that are less than 1 with the corresponding values from the array B.

This code is not likely to be repeated again because it is a very specific example of a Fortran program that uses a number of advanced features. It is not a general-purpose program that can be used for a wide variety of tasks.
