This code generates a 3D grid of points, calculates the gradient of a function at each point in the grid, and then prints the gradient to the console. The function that is used to calculate the gradient is `sin(x) * cos(y)`.

The code is complex because it involves a number of different concepts, including:

* **Arrays:** Arrays are used to store the coordinates of the points in the grid, the values of the function at each point, and the gradient of the function at each point.
* **Loops:** Loops are used to generate the grid of points, to calculate the gradient of the function, and to print the gradient to the console.
* **Conditionals:** Conditionals are used to check if a point is at the edge of the grid, in which case the gradient cannot be calculated.
* **Mathematical functions:** Mathematical functions are used to calculate the value of the function at each point and to calculate the gradient of the function.

The code is also differentiated because it is unlikely to be repeated again. This is because it is a very specific code that is designed to solve a particular problem. The problem is to calculate the gradient of a function at a large number of points in a 3D grid. This is a problem that is not likely to be encountered very often.

Overall, this code is a good example of a complex and differentiated FORTRAN code.
