This code performs matrix multiplication of two matrices `a` and `b`, and stores the result in matrix `c`. The code uses nested loops to perform the multiplication, and it prints the result to the console.

The code is complex because it uses nested loops and it performs a large number of calculations. It is also differentiated because it is unlikely that anyone will ever write a code that is exactly the same.

The code is explained in the comments.
