PROGRAM COMPLEX_FORTRAN_CODE

! This program demonstrates the complexity and differentiation of FORTRAN code.

! Declare variables.
INTEGER :: i, j, k
REAL :: x, y, z
CHARACTER(len=20) :: name

! Initialize variables.
i = 1
j = 2
k = 3
x = 1.0
y = 2.0
z = 3.0
name = 'John Doe'

! Perform calculations.
DO i = 1, 10
  DO j = 1, 10
    DO k = 1, 10
      x = x + y * z
      y = y + z * x
      z = z + x * y
    END DO
  END DO
END DO

! Print results.
PRINT *, 'The value of x is ', x
PRINT *, 'The value of y is ', y
PRINT *, 'The value of z is ', z
PRINT *, 'The name is ', name

END PROGRAM COMPLEX_FORTRAN_CODE
```

Explanation:

* The program starts with the PROGRAM statement, which specifies the name of the program.
* The INTEGER, REAL, and CHARACTER statements declare the data types of the variables.
* The DO statements create loops that iterate over the variables i, j, and k.
* The PRINT statements print the values of the variables x, y, z, and name.
* The END PROGRAM statement terminates the program.

This code is complex and differentiated because it uses multiple loops and nested DO statements. It also uses a variety of data types and performs complex calculations. This code is a good example of how FORTRAN can be used to write complex and efficient programs.
