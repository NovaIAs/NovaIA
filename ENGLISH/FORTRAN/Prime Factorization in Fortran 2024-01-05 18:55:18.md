This code is a Fortran program that finds the prime factors of a positive integer entered by the user. It uses a while loop to iterate through all the integers from 2 to the square root of the input integer, checking if each integer is a factor of the input integer. If an integer is a factor, the program uses another while loop to count how many times it divides the input integer, and then prints the integer and the count. The program continues this process until the input integer is 1, at which point all of its prime factors have been found.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The IMPLICIT NONE statement tells the compiler that no implicit typing is allowed, which means that every variable must be explicitly declared with a type. This makes the code more readable and helps to prevent errors.
* The INTEGER statement declares the variables N, I, J, and COUNT to be integers.
* The WRITE statement prompts the user to enter a positive integer.
* The READ statement reads the input integer from the user and stores it in the variable N.
* The WRITE statement prints a message to the console indicating that the program will find the prime factors of the input integer.
* The variable I is initialized to 2, which is the first prime number.
* The DO WHILE loop iterates through all the integers from 2 to the square root of the input integer. The square root is used as the upper limit because any prime factor of the input integer must be less than or equal to the square root.
* Inside the DO WHILE loop, the IF statement checks if the current value of I is a factor of the input integer. The MOD function is used to calculate the remainder when N is divided by I. If the remainder is 0, then I is a factor of N.
* If I is a factor of N, the program uses another DO WHILE loop to count how many times I divides N. The COUNT variable is used to keep track of the count.
* The N variable is then divided by I to remove the factor from N.
* The WRITE statement prints the current value of I and the count to the console.
* The I variable is then incremented by 1, and the DO WHILE loop continues.
* The DO WHILE loop continues until the input integer is 1, at which point all of its prime factors have been found.
* The END PROGRAM statement terminates the program.
