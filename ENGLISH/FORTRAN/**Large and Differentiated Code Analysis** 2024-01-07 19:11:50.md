This code generates three arrays of random numbers, calculates the mean and standard deviation of each array, and then prints the results. The code is complex and differentiated in the following ways:

* It uses a large number of data points (1 million).
* It calculates three different statistics (mean, standard deviation, and variance).
* It uses a subroutine to calculate the statistics, which makes the code more modular and easier to read.
* It uses a random number generator to generate the data, which makes the code more versatile and reusable.

The code is also well-commented, which makes it easier to understand and modify.
