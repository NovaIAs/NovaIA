This code performs matrix multiplication of two n x n matrices, a and b, and stores the result in matrix c. The code is complex because it uses nested loops to perform the multiplication, which can be difficult to understand and maintain.

The code is divided into three main parts:

1. The first part initializes matrices a and b with random numbers.
2. The second part computes matrix c = a * b using nested loops.
3. The third part prints matrix c.

The code uses the following variables:

* `n` is the size of the matrices a, b, and c.
* `a`, `b`, and `c` are three n x n matrices.
* `i`, `j`, and `k` are loop indices.

The code uses the following functions:

* `random_number()` generates a random number between 0 and 1.
* `write(*,*)` prints a value to the console.

The code is complex because it uses nested loops to perform the matrix multiplication. The outer loops (the loops over `i` and `j`) iterate over the rows and columns of matrix c, respectively. The inner loop (the loop over `k`) iterates over the elements of matrix a and b that are used to compute the corresponding element of matrix c.

The code is difficult to understand and maintain because it is not easy to see how the loops are related to each other and how they work together to compute the matrix multiplication. Additionally, the code is not very efficient because it uses nested loops, which can be slow for large matrices.
