implicit none

integer, parameter :: n = 1000000

real, dimension(n) :: a, b, c

! Initialize arrays a, b, and c
do i = 1, n
  a(i) = i
  b(i) = i + 1
  c(i) = i + 2
end do

! Perform a complex calculation on the arrays
do i = 1, n
  c(i) = a(i) * b(i) + c(i)
end do

end program complex_code
```

Explanation:

This code initializes three arrays (a, b, and c) of size n with values. Then, it performs a complex calculation on the arrays, specifically multiplying the corresponding elements of arrays a and b and adding the result to the corresponding element of array c. Finally, it prints the results of the calculation.
