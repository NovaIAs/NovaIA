This code is a program that sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
The program first asks the user to enter the size of the array, then it asks the user to enter the elements of the array.
The program then sorts the array in ascending order using a bubble sort algorithm.
Finally, the program prints the sorted array.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

* The first line of the program is the program header.
It specifies the name of the program (sort_array) and the language in which it is written (Fortran).

* The second line of the program is the implicit none statement.
This statement tells the compiler that no implicit typing is allowed in the program.
This means that every variable must be explicitly declared with a type.

* The third line of the program declares an integer array named array with a size of 100.
This means that the array can hold up to 100 integers.

* The fourth line of the program declares three integer variables named i, j, and temp.
These variables will be used to sort the array.

* The fifth line of the program is a print statement that prompts the user to enter the size of the array.

* The sixth line of the program is a read statement that reads the size of the array from the user.

* The seventh line of the program is a print statement that prompts the user to enter the elements of the array.

* The eighth line of the program is a do loop that iterates from 1 to the size of the array.
Inside the loop, the user is prompted to enter an integer, and the integer is stored in the array.

* The ninth line of the program is a do loop that iterates from 1 to the size of the array minus 1.
Inside the loop, there is another do loop that iterates from i + 1 to the size of the array.
These two loops are used to compare each element of the array to every other element of the array.

* The tenth line of the program is an if statement that checks if the current element of the array is greater than the next element of the array.
If the current element is greater than the next element, then the two elements are swapped.

* The eleventh line of the program is an end if statement.

* The twelfth line of the program is an end do statement that ends the inner do loop.

* The thirteenth line of the program is an end do statement that ends the outer do loop.

* The fourteenth line of the program is a print statement that prints the sorted array.

* The fifteenth line of the program is a do loop that iterates from 1 to the size of the array.
Inside the loop, the current element of the array is printed.

* The sixteenth line of the program is an end do statement that ends the do loop.

* The seventeenth line of the program is an end program statement that ends the program.
