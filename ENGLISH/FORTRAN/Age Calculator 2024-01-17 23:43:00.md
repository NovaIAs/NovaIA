Explanation:

This program asks the user for their first name, last name, age, and the current year. It then calculates the year they will turn 100 years old and prints a message to the user.

The program first declares the variables that will be used in the program. The IMPLICIT NONE statement tells the compiler that all variables must be explicitly declared before they can be used.

The PRINT *, "What is your first name?" statement prints a message to the user asking for their first name. The READ *, first_name statement reads the user's input and stores it in the first_name variable.

The PRINT *, "What is your last name?" statement prints a message to the user asking for their last name. The READ *, name statement reads the user's input and stores it in the name variable.

The PRINT *, "What is your age?" statement prints a message to the user asking for their age. The READ *, age statement reads the user's input and stores it in the age variable.

The PRINT *, "What year is it?" statement prints a message to the user asking for the current year. The READ *, year statement reads the user's input and stores it in the year variable.

The age_at_death variable is calculated by adding 100 to the current year and subtracting the user's age.

The PRINT *, "Hello, ", first_name, name, "!" statement prints a message to the user greeting them by their first and last name.

The PRINT *, "You are ", age, " years old." statement prints a message to the user telling them their age.

The PRINT *, "You will be 100 years old in ", age_at_death, "." statement prints a message to the user telling them the year they will turn 100 years old.
