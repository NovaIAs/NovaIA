! Initialize the arrays

This code performs a complex series of calculations on three arrays of data. The code first initializes the arrays with values, then performs a series of calculations on the arrays, and finally outputs the results.

The code is complex because it uses a number of different mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The code also uses a number of different loops, including do loops and for loops.

The code is also differentiated because it is unlikely to be repeated again. The code is specific to the problem that it is trying to solve, and it is unlikely that another problem will require the same exact calculations.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

* The first line of the code is the program statement. This statement tells the compiler that this is a Fortran program.
* The second line of the code is the implicit none statement. This statement tells the compiler that all variables must be explicitly declared. This helps to catch errors in the code.
* The third line of the code is the integer, parameter :: N = 10000 statement. This statement declares an integer parameter named N and sets it to the value 10000. This parameter is used to specify the size of the arrays.
* The fourth, fifth, and sixth lines of the code declare three real arrays named x, y, and z. The arrays are each dimensioned to N.
* The next do loop initializes the arrays with values. The loop iterates from 1 to N, and for each iteration, the value of x(i) is set to i, the value of y(i) is set to 2 * i, and the value of z(i) is set to 3 * i.
* The next do loop performs a series of calculations on the arrays. The loop iterates from 1 to N, and for each iteration, the value of x(i) is set to x(i) + y(i) * z(i), the value of y(i) is set to y(i) * z(i) - x(i), and the value of z(i) is set to z(i) + x(i) * y(i).
* The final do loop outputs the results. The loop iterates from 1 to 10, and for each iteration, the values of x(i), y(i), and z(i) are printed to the console.
