Certainly! Below is a complex FORTRAN code that solves the N-Queens problem using a genetic algorithm approach. The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

This code solves the N-Queens problem using a genetic algorithm. It starts by randomly initializing a population of potential solutions. Each solution represents a placement of queens on the chessboard. At each iteration, the fitness of each individual in the population is calculated based on the number of conflicts between queens. The fitness values are then normalized and used to select parents for reproduction using a roulette wheel selection mechanism.

Crossover and mutation operations are performed on the selected parents to generate offspring. The crossover operation randomly selects genetic material from both parents. The mutation operation randomly modifies certain genes in the offspring, introducing genetic diversity. The offspring replace individuals in the population, and this process continues until a solution is found or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

If a solution is found, the code outputs the positions of the queens. Otherwise, it indicates that no solution was found within the given iteration limit.

Note: The code provided is a simplified version for N=8. For larger values of N, you may need to adjust the parameters like `MAX_POP` and `MAX_ITER` to obtain better results.
