**Explanation:**

This code is a main program for a finite element analysis code. It includes the necessary modules, declares the main program, and contains the main subroutine. The main subroutine reads the input data, creates the finite element model, solves the finite element equations, and outputs the results.

The `READ_INPUT_DATA` subroutine reads the input data from a file. The input data includes the number of nodes, the number of elements, the number of materials, the number of loads, and the time at which the analysis is to be performed.

The `CREATE_FE_MODEL` subroutine creates the finite element model. The finite element model includes the nodes, the elements, the materials, and the loads.

The `SOLVE_FE_EQUATIONS` subroutine solves the finite element equations. The finite element equations are a set of linear equations that describe the behavior of the finite element model.

The `OUTPUT_RESULTS` subroutine outputs the results of the analysis. The results include the displacements of the nodes, the stresses in the elements, and the reactions at the supports.
