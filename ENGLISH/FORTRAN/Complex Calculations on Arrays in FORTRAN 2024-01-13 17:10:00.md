**Explanation:**

This is a complex FORTRAN code that performs complex calculations on arrays of real and complex numbers.

* The program first declares the size of the arrays (`n`) and the data types of the arrays (`real(kind=8)` for the real arrays and `complex(kind=16)` for the complex arrays).
* It then initializes the arrays with values using the array constructor syntax (`(/ (expression, i=start,stop) /)`).
* The program then performs complex calculations on the arrays using the `+` and `*` operators.
* Finally, the program prints the results of the calculations to the console.

This code is complex because it uses a variety of features of the FORTRAN language, including:

* Arrays
* Complex numbers
* Operators
* Input and output

It is also complex because it performs a series of calculations on the arrays, which can be difficult to follow.
