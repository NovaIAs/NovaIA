```fortran
program complex_code

implicit none

integer, parameter :: n = 1000 ! Size of arrays

real, dimension(n) :: a, b, c ! Arrays of real numbers

! Initialize arrays
do i = 1, n

Explanation:

* The program starts with a `program` statement, which specifies the name of the program (`complex_code`) and declares that it is a Fortran program. There are three sections in the program: declaration, initialization, and calculation.

* The declaration section declares the variables used in the program, including the arrays `a`, `b`, and `c`, and the integer parameter `n` that specifies the size of the arrays.

* The initialization section uses a `do` loop to initialize the arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` with values from 1 to `n`.

* The calculation section uses another `do` loop to calculate the values of the array `c` using a complex expression that involves the arrays `a` and `b`.

* The final section uses a `do` loop to print the values of the arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` to the console.
