This code is a complex program that performs some calculations on a large array of data. The code is written in FORTRAN, which is a programming language that is often used for scientific and engineering applications.

The program first declares a number of variables, including an array of size `n` to store the data. The code then calculates the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` for each point in the array.

Next, the code performs some complex calculations on the data. These calculations are defined by the following three lines of code:

```fortran
x(i) = x(i) * y(i) * z(i)
y(i) = y(i) + z(i)
z(i) = z(i) - x(i)
```

These lines of code perform a series of multiplications, additions, and subtractions on the data in the arrays `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Finally, the code prints the results of the calculations to the console. The output of the program will be a list of the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` for each point in the array.

This code is complex and difficult to understand, but it is a good example of how FORTRAN can be used to perform complex calculations on large arrays of data.
