This code performs a complex series of calculations on arrays of real and complex numbers. The code is divided into three main sections:

1. **Initialization:** The code begins by initializing the arrays `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` with values. The arrays `x` and `y` are real arrays, while `z` and `w` are complex arrays.
2. **Calculations:** The code then performs a series of complex calculations on the arrays. These calculations include multiplying the complex numbers in `w` by the real numbers in `z`, taking the square root of the complex numbers in `w`, and dividing the complex numbers in `w` by the complex numbers `1.0 + w(i)`.
3. **Output:** Finally, the code prints the results of the calculations to the console.

This code is complex and difficult to understand, but it demonstrates the power of the FORTRAN programming language. FORTRAN is a powerful language that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems, including those that require complex calculations.
