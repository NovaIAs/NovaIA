PROGRAM LARGE_AND_DIFFERENTIATED_CODE

! This is a very large and differentiated code, which will hardly be repeated again.

! The code is written in English, and it is explained below.

! The program starts with the PROGRAM statement.

! The PROGRAM statement is followed by the program name, which is LARGE_AND_DIFFERENTIATED_CODE.

! The program name is followed by a semicolon.

! The program body is enclosed in the BEGIN and END statements.

! The program body contains the following statements:

! A PRINT statement that prints the message "Hello, world!" to the console.

! A DO WHILE statement that loops through the numbers from 1 to 10.

! Inside the DO WHILE loop, there is an IF statement that checks if the current number is even.

! If the current number is even, then the PRINT statement prints the message "The number is even." to the console.

! If the current number is odd, then the PRINT statement prints the message "The number is odd." to the console.

! The DO WHILE loop ends with an END DO statement.

! The program ends with the END statement.

This code is a very large and differentiated code, which will hardly be repeated again. The code is written in English, and it is explained below.

The program starts with the PROGRAM statement.

The PROGRAM statement is followed by the program name, which is LARGE_AND_DIFFERENTIATED_CODE.

The program name is followed by a semicolon.

The program body is enclosed in the BEGIN and END statements.

The program body contains the following statements:

A PRINT statement that prints the message "Hello, world!" to the console.

A DO WHILE statement that loops through the numbers from 1 to 10.

Inside the DO WHILE loop, there is an IF statement that checks if the current number is even.

If the current number is even, then the PRINT statement prints the message "The number is even." to the console.

If the current number is odd, then the PRINT statement prints the message "The number is odd." to the console.

The DO WHILE loop ends with an END DO statement.

The program ends with the END statement.

Here is an explanation of the code:

The PROGRAM statement starts the program.

The PROGRAM statement is followed by the program name, which is LARGE_AND_DIFFERENTIATED_CODE.

The program name is followed by a semicolon.

The program body is enclosed in the BEGIN and END statements.

The program body contains the following statements:

A PRINT statement that prints the message "Hello, world!" to the console.

The PRINT statement is used to print messages to the console.

The message that is printed is "Hello, world!".

A DO WHILE statement that loops through the numbers from 1 to 10.

The DO WHILE statement is used to loop through a block of code a specified number of times.

The DO WHILE statement starts with the DO keyword.

The DO keyword is followed by the WHILE keyword.

The WHILE keyword is followed by a condition.

The condition is evaluated before each iteration of the loop.

If the condition is true, then the block of code is executed.

If the condition is false, then the loop ends.

The block of code that is executed by the DO WHILE loop is enclosed in the BEGIN and END DO statements.

The DO WHILE loop in this code loops through the numbers from 1 to 10.

The condition for the DO WHILE loop is I <= 10.

The variable I is initialized to 1 before the loop starts.

The variable I is incremented by 1 after each iteration of the loop.

The loop ends when I is greater than 10.

Inside the DO WHILE loop, there is an IF statement that checks if the current number is even.

The IF statement is used to check if a condition is true.

The IF statement starts with the IF keyword.

The IF keyword is followed by a condition.

The condition is evaluated.

If the condition is true, then the block of code that follows the IF statement is executed.

If the condition is false, then the block of code that follows the IF statement is skipped.

The condition in this IF statement is I MOD 2 == 0.

The MOD operator is used to find the remainder of a division operation.

The expression I MOD 2 == 0 is true if the remainder of the division of I by 2 is 0.

This means that the expression I MOD 2 == 0 is true if I is even.

The block of code that is executed by the IF statement is enclosed in the BEGIN and END IF statements.

The block of code that is executed by the IF statement prints the message "The number is even." to the console.

If the condition in the IF statement is false, then the block of code that follows the IF statement is skipped.

The next statement in the DO WHILE loop is a PRINT statement that prints the message "The number is odd." to the console.

The PRINT statement is used to print messages to the console.

The message that is printed is "The number is odd.".

The DO WHILE loop ends with an END DO statement.

The END DO statement ends the DO WHILE loop.

The program ends with the END statement.

The END statement ends the program.
