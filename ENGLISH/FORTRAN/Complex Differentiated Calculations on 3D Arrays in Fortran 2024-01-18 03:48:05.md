Explanation:

* The code is written in Fortran 95
* It declares 3D arrays `a`, `b`, and `c` of size `max_size x max_size`
* The arrays are initialized with random values
* A complex and differentiated calculation is performed on the arrays
* The result is printed to the console

The calculation performed in the code is a combination of matrix multiplication and element-wise operations. The code is complex and differentiated because it involves multiple loops and operations on large arrays. It is unlikely to be repeated again exactly the same way because it is generated randomly.
