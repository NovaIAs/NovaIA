Explanation:

1. factorial: Calculates the factorial of a given number n. It uses a loop to repeatedly multiply n with itself until it reaches 1.

2. is-prime?: Checks if a given number n is prime. It does this by checking if n is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of n. If it finds a divisor, it returns false; otherwise, it returns true.

3. goldbach-pair: Finds a pair of prime numbers that sum up to a given number n. It uses nested loops to generate all possible pairs of prime numbers and checks if their sum is equal to n. If it finds a pair, it returns them; otherwise, it returns nothing.

4. print-separately: Prints two strings with a space in between.

5. print-together: Prints two strings together without a space in between.

6. print-list: Prints a list of numbers. It uses a loop to print each number on a new line.

7. main: The entry point of the program. It calls the other functions to perform various calculations and prints the results.

This code demonstrates various aspects of FORTH, including loops, conditionals, recursion, and string manipulation. It also showcases the use of FORTH's stack-based architecture for efficient data manipulation.
