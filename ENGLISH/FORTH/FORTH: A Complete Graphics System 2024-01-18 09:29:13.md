- `Paint canvas`: This line paints the canvas with a solid color.
- `Paint palette`: This line paints the palette with the colors from the color palette.
- `Draw picture`: This line draws a picture on the canvas.
- `Start system`: This line starts the main loop of the system.
- `Main loop`: This is the main loop of the system. It repeatedly parses events, calls user code, and updates the screen.

Please note that this code is just a high-level overview of a possible FORTH system. The actual code would be much more complex and would depend on the specific implementation.
