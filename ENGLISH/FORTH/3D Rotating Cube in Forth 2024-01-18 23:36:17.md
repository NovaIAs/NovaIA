Explanation:

This Forth code is a complex and differentiated program that draws a 3D rotating cube on the screen.

The code starts by defining a few constants and variables, including `n`, which is the size of the cube, and `rotate90`, which is a function that rotates the cube by 90 degrees.

The next section of the code defines the `cube` function, which draws the cube. The `cube` function uses a loop to draw each of the six sides of the cube. For each side, the function uses the `line` function to draw the four edges of the side.

The `line` function is defined next. The `line` function uses the `DRAW` function to draw a line from one point to another. The `DRAW` function takes three arguments: the x-coordinate of the starting point, the y-coordinate of the starting point, and the color of the line.

The last section of the code uses a loop to draw five cubes of different sizes and colors. The loop uses the `cube` function to draw each cube. The `cube` function is called with different values for `x`, `y`, `z`, `color1`, and `color2` to draw cubes of different sizes and colors.

This code is a complex and differentiated example of Forth programming. It shows how Forth can be used to create complex graphics programs.
