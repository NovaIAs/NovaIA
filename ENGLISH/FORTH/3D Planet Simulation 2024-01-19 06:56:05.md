This Forth program simulates a large number of planets moving in a 3D space. It uses a simple physics model to calculate the forces between the planets and to update their positions and velocities over time. The program also includes a graphical display that shows the planets in motion.

The program starts by defining a number of constants and variables. The constants XMIN, XMAX, DX, YMIN, YMAX, and DY define the boundaries of the 3D space in which the planets will move. The variables px, py, pz, sx, sy, sz, x, y, and z are used to store the positions and velocities of the planets.

The program then enters a loop that iterates over all the points in the 3D space. For each point, it calculates the forces between the planets and updates their positions and velocities. The program also checks if any of the planets have collided with each other. If a collision occurs, the two planets are merged into a single planet.

After all the planets have been updated, the program displays them in the graphical window. The program uses the PMAP function to convert the 3D coordinates of each planet into a 2D point on the screen. The program then uses the SHOWPLANET function to draw the planet on the screen.

The program continues to loop until the user presses the ESC key. When the ESC key is pressed, the program exits and returns to the command line.

Here is a brief explanation of the Forth code:

* The FACT word calculates the factorial of a number.
* The SUM word calculates the sum of two numbers.
* The CYCLE word repeatedly executes a loop a specified number of times.
* The XMIN, XMAX, DX, YMIN, YMAX, and DY words define the boundaries of the 3D space in which the planets will move.
* The px, py, pz, sx, sy, sz, x, y, and z variables are used to store the positions and velocities of the planets.
* The INITIAL word initializes the planets.
* The RND word generates a random number.
* The RSQ word calculates the square of a number.
* The MAG word calculates the magnitude of a vector.
* The LENGTH word calculates the length of a vector.
* The UNITV word calculates the unit vector of a vector.
* The FULL word calculates a random number between 0 and a specified number.
* The MOD word calculates the remainder of a division operation.
* The PLANET word calculates the forces between two planets and updates their positions and velocities.
* The SHOW word displays the coordinates of a point.
* The RNDXYZ word generates a random 3D vector.
* The PMAP word converts a 3D vector into a 2D point.
* The SHOWPLANET word draws a planet on the screen.
* The MAIN word is the entry point of the program.
