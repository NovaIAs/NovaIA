This Forth program generates a Sierpinski Carpet fractal of a given order. The Sierpinski Carpet is a geometric pattern that is constructed by recursively dividing a square into nine smaller squares, removing the center square, and repeating the process with the remaining squares. The order of the fractal specifies how many times this process is repeated.

The program first prompts the user to enter the order of the Sierpinski Carpet they want to generate. It then uses a loop to generate and display the fractal.

The `show-stars` word prints a given number of stars, separated by spaces. The `show-line` word prints a line of stars of a given length.

The `sierpinski-carpet` word recursively generates the Sierpinski Carpet fractal. It first checks if the order is equal to 1. If it is, it simply prints a single line of stars. Otherwise, it recursively generates the fractal for the left half and right half of the square, and then prints a line of stars between them. It repeats this process until the order is equal to 1.

The `main` word prompts the user to enter the order of the Sierpinski Carpet they want to generate, and then calls the `sierpinski-carpet` word to generate and display the fractal.
