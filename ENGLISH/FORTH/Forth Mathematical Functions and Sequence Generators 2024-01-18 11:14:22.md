This code contains several Forth definitions that perform various calculations and produce different output formats based on user input. Here's a breakdown of each definition:

1. `POWERED`: Calculates `n^k` using a recursive algorithm and saves the result in the return stack.

2. `FACTORIAL`: This calculates the factorial of a given number by iteratively multiplying all integers from 1 up to the number.

3. `FIB`: Calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms, showing the sequence in the console.

4. `PRINT.` and `PRINT.CR`: These are utility definitions for outputting a value followed by a newline.

5. `SMALL.FACTORIAL` and `LARGE.FACTORIAL`: These definitions test the `FACTORIAL` implementation by calculating the factorial of different numbers and displaying the results.

6. `WORD.LIST`: This definition prints a list of words from a string, where each word is separated by a space.

7. `PRINT.WORDS`: This definition uses `WORD.LIST` to print a list of words from the string "small factorial" 10 times, resulting in a set of 10 lines with the phrase repeated.

8. `PRINT.BIG.WORDS`: Similar to `PRINT.WORDS`, but it prints the string "large factorial" 10 times.

9. `MAP.FIB`: This definition generates a list of Fibonacci numbers up to a specified term and displays them in a formatted manner.

10. `BIG.MAP.FIB`: Calculates and displays the Fibonacci sequence up to 1000 terms, highlighting the extensive capabilities of the algorithm.
