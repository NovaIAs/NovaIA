This code implements the FizzBuzz algorithm in FORTH. The algorithm prints numbers from 1 to n, but for multiples of 3 it prints 'Fizz' instead of the number, for multiples of 5 it prints 'Buzz' instead of the number, and for multiples of both 3 and 5 it prints 'FizzBuzz'.

The code first defines a colon definition named `FIZZBUZZ` which takes a single number as input and prints the FizzBuzz sequence up to that number. The definition uses a `DO` loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to the input number. Inside the loop, the `MOD` word is used to check if the current number is a multiple of 3, 5, or both. If it is a multiple of 3, the word `'FIZZ!` is printed. If it is a multiple of 5, the word `'BUZZ!` is printed. If it is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the word `'FIZZBUZZ!` is printed. Otherwise, the current number is printed using the `NUMBER!` word. After the loop is finished, the stack is dropped and a carriage return is printed.

The code then defines a second colon definition named `TEST-FIZZBUZZ` which simply calls the `FIZZBUZZ` definition with the number 100 as input. This definition is used to test the FizzBuzz algorithm.

To use the code, simply type `TEST-FIZZBUZZ` into the FORTH interpreter. The output will be the FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to 100.
