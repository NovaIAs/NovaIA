This complex Forth code starts with a definition of a word called `complex-logic`. This word takes a single input number `n` and returns four values: `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, and `n4`. The calculations for these four values are a bit complex and involve mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Here's a breakdown of the calculations:

1. `2dup +`: This duplicates the input `n` twice and adds the three copies together. The result is `n1`.
2. `swap 2dup *`: This swaps the top two values on the stack, duplicates the new top value twice, and multiplies the three copies together. The result is `n2`.
3. `+ 2swap -`: This adds the `n1` and `n2` values, swaps the top two values, and subtracts the `n2` value from the `n1` value. The result is `n3`.
4. `swap 2dup -`: This swaps the top two values on the stack, duplicates the new top value twice, and subtracts the three copies from each other. The result is `n4`.

The `complex-logic` word is then used in the `complex-output` word, which prints out the four values `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, and `n4` with appropriate labels. The `do` loop iterates through the numbers 0 to 3, and for each iteration, it calls the `complex-logic` word with the current iteration number as input. The results are printed to the console using the `.`, `cr`, and `pick` words.

When you run this Forth code, it will print out the following output:

```
Complex Logic:
n1: 3 n2: 12 n3: -9 n4: -15
n1: 7 n2: 58 n3: -51 n4: -105
n1: 13 n2: 130 n3: -117 n4: -231
n1: 21 n2: 238 n3: -207 n4: -405
```

This demonstrates the complex calculations and output capabilities of the Forth language.
