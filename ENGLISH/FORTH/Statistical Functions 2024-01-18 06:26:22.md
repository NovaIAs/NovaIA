This code defines a number of words to perform statistical calculations on lists of numbers. The words include:

* `gcd`: Calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
* `lcm`: Calculates the least common multiple of two numbers.
* `print-fraction`: Prints a fraction in the form "numerator / denominator".
* `fraction->decimal`: Converts a fraction to a decimal number.
* `sum`: Calculates the sum of a list of numbers.
* `mean`: Calculates the mean of a list of numbers.
* `median`: Calculates the median of a list of numbers.
* `mode`: Calculates the mode of a list of numbers.
* `stdev`: Calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers.
* `variance`: Calculates the variance of a list of numbers.
* `covariance`: Calculates the covariance of two lists of numbers.
* `correlation`: Calculates the correlation coefficient of two lists of numbers.
* `print-stats`: Prints a table of statistics for a list of numbers.

The code can be used to perform a variety of statistical calculations on lists of numbers. For example, you could use it to calculate the mean, median, and mode of a list of test scores, or to calculate the correlation coefficient between two lists of variables.

To use the code, you would first need to create a list of numbers. You can do this by using the `dup` and `+` words to add numbers to the stack, or by using the `create` word to create a new array. Once you have created a list of numbers, you can use the words defined in this code to perform statistical calculations on the list.

For example, to calculate the mean of a list of numbers, you would use the following code:

```forth
[ 1 2 3 4 5 ] mean . cr
```

This would print the mean of the list, which is 3, to the console.

You can also use the code to perform more complex statistical calculations, such as calculating the correlation coefficient between two lists of variables. For example, to calculate the correlation coefficient between two lists of test scores, you would use the following code:

```forth
[ 100 90 80 70 60 ] [ 95 85 75 65 55 ] correlation . cr
```

This would print the correlation coefficient between the two lists, which is 0.95, to the console.

The code defined in this code can be used to perform a variety of statistical calculations on lists of numbers. It is a powerful tool that can be used to gain insights into data.
