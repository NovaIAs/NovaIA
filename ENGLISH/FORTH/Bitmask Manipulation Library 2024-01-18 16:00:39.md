This code implements a Forth library for manipulating bitmasks. It includes functions to create bitmasks, perform set operations on bitmasks, and apply unary and binary operations to bitmasks. The code also includes a function to convert a number to a bitmask and a function to check if a number is a natural number (a non-negative integer).

The main functions in the library are:

* `JOIN`: This function takes two bitmasks as arguments and returns a new bitmask that is the union of the two input bitmasks.
* `union`: This function takes two bitmasks as arguments and returns a new bitmask that is the union of the two input bitmasks.
* `inter`: This function takes two bitmasks as arguments and returns a new bitmask that is the intersection of the two input bitmasks.
* `eq`: This function takes two bitmasks as arguments and returns a flag indicating whether the two bitmasks are equal.
* `unary`: This function takes a bitmask and a unary operation as arguments and returns a new bitmask that is the result of applying the unary operation to the input bitmask.
* `binary`: This function takes two bitmasks and a binary operation as arguments and returns a new bitmask that is the result of applying the binary operation to the two input bitmasks.
* `build-table`: This function takes a number as an argument and returns a new bitmask that contains all the bits set to 1 up to the specified number.
* `number`: This function takes a bitmask as an argument and returns the number that corresponds to the bitmask.
* `nat?`: This function takes a number as an argument and returns a flag indicating whether the number is a natural number.
* `stack-op`: This function takes a stack operation as an argument and performs the operation on the stack.
* `table-op`: This function takes a table operation as an argument and performs the operation on the table.
* `binop`: This function takes two stack operations and a binary operation as arguments and performs the binary operation on the two input operations.

The `time` word is an example of how to use the library to create a bitmask representing a time in MMDD or MMDDHHMM format. The `timem` word is an example of how to use the library to print a time bitmask.
