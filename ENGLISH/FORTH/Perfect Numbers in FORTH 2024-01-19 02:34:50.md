This code is written in FORTH, a stack-based programming language. It defines several functions:

* **is-prime**: This function takes a number as input and returns true if it is prime, and false otherwise. It does this by iterating over all numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number and checking if any of them divide the input number evenly. If any of them do, then the input number is not prime, and the function returns false. Otherwise, the input number is prime, and the function returns true.

* **prime?**: This function is the opposite of the **is-prime** function. It takes a number as input and returns true if it is not prime, and false otherwise.

* **primes**: This function prints a list of all prime numbers up to a certain limit. It does this by starting at 2 and iterating over all positive integers. For each integer, it checks if it is prime using the **is-prime** function. If it is prime, it prints it to the console.

* **divisors**: This function takes a number as input and prints a list of all of its divisors. It does this by iterating over all positive integers up to the square root of the input number. For each integer, it checks if it divides the input number evenly. If it does, it prints it to the console.

* **perfect?**: This function takes a number as input and returns true if it is a perfect number, and false otherwise. A perfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (i.e., all of its divisors except itself). The function calculates the sum of the input number's proper divisors using the **divisors** function and then checks if this sum is equal to the input number. If it is, then the input number is a perfect number, and the function returns true. Otherwise, the input number is not a perfect number, and the function returns false.

* **perfect-numbers**: This function prints a list of all perfect numbers up to a certain limit. It does this by starting at 1 and iterating over all positive integers. For each integer, it checks if it is a perfect number using the **perfect?** function. If it is, it prints it to the console.
