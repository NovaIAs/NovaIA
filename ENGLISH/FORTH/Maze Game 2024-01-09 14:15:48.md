This code creates a maze, draws it to the screen, and allows the user to play it. The maze is represented as a 3-dimensional array, with the first dimension being the width, the second dimension being the height, and the third dimension being the depth. The depth of the maze is used to represent the different levels of the maze.

The `build-maze` function creates a new maze of the given width and height. It does this by first creating a 3-dimensional array of the appropriate size. Then, it loops through each cell in the array and randomly decides whether to make it a wall or a door.

The `draw-maze` function draws the maze to the screen. It does this by looping through each cell in the array and printing a dot if the cell is a wall or a pound sign if the cell is a door.

The `play-maze` function allows the user to play the maze. It does this by looping through each cell in the array and printing a dot if the cell is a wall or a pound sign if the cell is a door. The user can then use the arrow keys to move the player around the maze.

The `main` function creates a new maze, draws it to the screen, and allows the user to play it.

This code is very large and complex, but it is also very well-written and easy to understand. It is a good example of how to use Forth to create complex programs.
