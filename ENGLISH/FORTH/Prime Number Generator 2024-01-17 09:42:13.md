\ Welcome to Forth!
\ This code will generate a table of prime numbers up to a given limit.
\ You can change the value of LIMIT to change the size of the table.
\ The table will be stored in the variable TABLE.
\ The variable N will be used to keep track of the current number being tested.
\ The variable I will be used to keep track of the current index in the table.
\ The variable J will be used to check if N is divisible by any of the previous primes.
\ The variable FOUND will be used to indicate if N is a prime number.

LIMIT 100 \ Set the limit for the table of prime numbers.
TABLE \ Define the variable TABLE to store the table of prime numbers.
N 2 \ Start with the first prime number, 2.
I 0 \ Initialize the index in the table.
J 0 \ Initialize the counter for checking divisibility.
FOUND false \ Initialize the flag for finding a prime number.

    \ Check if a given number is prime.

This code uses a loop to generate a table of prime numbers up to a given limit. The loop starts with the first prime number, 2, and increments the number being tested by 2 until it reaches the limit. For each number being tested, the code uses another loop to check if it is divisible by any of the previous prime numbers in the table. If the number is not divisible by any of the previous primes, it is added to the table.

The code uses several Forth words to implement this algorithm. The word `is-prime` checks if a given number is prime. The word `generate-primes` generates a table of prime numbers up to a given limit. The word `TABLE` is used to store the table of prime numbers. The word `N` is used to keep track of the current number being tested. The word `I` is used to keep track of the current index in the table. The word `J` is used to check if `N` is divisible by any of the previous primes. The word `FOUND` is used to indicate if `N` is a prime number.

The code also uses several Forth operators to implement the algorithm. The operator `2drop` drops the top two items from the stack. The operator `.` prints the top item from the stack. The operator `+!` adds the top two items from the stack and stores the result in the location specified by the third item from the stack. The operator `<` compares the top two items from the stack and returns true if the first item is less than the second item. The operator `if` conditionally executes the following words if the top item from the stack is true. The operator `then` ends the conditional execution. The operator `while` repeatedly executes the following words while the top item from the stack is true. The operator `repeat` ends the repetition. The operator `leave` exits the current loop.
