This code implements a queue data structure in Forth. A queue is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure, which means that the first item that is added to the queue is the first item that is removed.

The code first defines a word called `100-times` which takes a number as its input and executes a loop 100 times. The `word` word takes an address and a length as its inputs and prints the contents of the memory at that address. The `cons` word takes two inputs and creates a new cell in memory which contains the first input as its data and the second input as the address of the next cell in the queue. The `print-word` word takes an address as its input and prints the contents of the memory at that address. The `del-word` word takes an address and a length as its inputs and deletes the specified number of cells from memory.

The `queue` word creates a new queue cell in memory. The `enq` word takes a queue and an item as its inputs and adds the item to the queue. The `deq` word takes a queue as its input and removes the first item from the queue.

The `test-queue` word tests the queue data structure by adding 100 items to the queue and then removing them one by one.
