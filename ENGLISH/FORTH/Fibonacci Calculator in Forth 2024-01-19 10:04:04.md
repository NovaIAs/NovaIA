This code can be divided in three parts:

1. The first part defines a function called `50-fibs` that calculates the first 50 Fibonacci Numbers, and stores it in an array.
2. The second part defines a function called `print-nums` that iterates through an array and prints its values.
3. The third part calculates the first 50 Fibonacci Numbers using a recursive function, and then prints them using the `print-nums` function.

The code is written in a Forth-like language called Forth, and it is a stack-based language, which means that the data is stored in a stack, and the operations are performed on the top of the stack.

The code uses the following Forth words:

* `create` - creates a new variable.
* `,` - stores a value in a variable.
* `swap` - swaps the top two values on the stack.
* `dup` - duplicates the top value on the stack.
* `@` - fetches the value of a variable.
* `+` - adds two values.
* `-` - subtracts two values.
* `2drop` - drops the top two values on the stack.
* `emit` - prints a character.
* `space` - prints a space.
* `while` - loops until the top value on the stack is false.
* `repeat` - repeats the loop the number of times specified by the top value on the stack.
* `drop` - drops the top value on the stack.
* `if` - performs a conditional branch.
* `else` - performs the else branch of a conditional branch.
* `then` - ends a conditional branch.

The code uses a technique called "thrashing", which means that it uses the same variable for multiple purposes.

For example, the variable `fibs` is used to store the Fibonacci numbers, and it is also used to store the number of Fibonacci numbers to calculate.

This technique is used to save memory, but it can make the code difficult to understand.
