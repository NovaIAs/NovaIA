This code defines a Forth word called `PRINT-INT` that prints an integer as a character string. It handles numbers between -32767 and 32767 and displays them on a 10-character display.

The code uses a loop to repeatedly divide the number by 10 and add 48 (the ASCII code for '0') to the remainder. This converts the number into a character string representation. If the number is negative, it prints a minus sign before the digits.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `CREATE START`: Creates a new word called `START`. This word is used to define a loop that will be used to print the integer.

2. The `[` and `]` characters define the body of the `START` word.

3. `12 DUP WHILE`: Duplicates the number 12 and starts a loop that will continue as long as the duplicated number is greater than 0. This loop is used to print a total of 12 characters, which is enough to display an integer between -32767 and 32767.

4. Inside the loop, `ROT [']' TYPE]` rotates the top three stack items, prints the character represented by the top stack item (which is a character code), and drops the top stack item. This effectively prints one character from the integer representation.

5. The `DROP DROP` drops the remaining two stack items, which are the rotated values.

6. `REPEAT` ends the loop started by `WHILE`.

7. `DROP` drops the final stack item, which is the original number that was passed to the `PRINT-INT` word.

8. `[ ... ] START ;` defines the `PRINT-INT` word. The body of the word is enclosed in square brackets, and the `;` at the end terminates the definition.

9. Within the `PRINT-INT` word, there are several conditional statements that handle different cases:

   - `2DUP 0 <`: Duplicates the top two stack items and checks if the top stack item is less than 0. If it is, it means the number is negative, so it prints a minus sign.

   - `[ DROP - ] SWAP 2DROP`: If the number is negative, it drops the top stack item (which is the duplicated negative number), negates the number, and swaps the top two stack items. This effectively converts the negative number to a positive number.

   - `DUP 9999 >`: Duplicates the top stack item and checks if it is greater than 9999. If it is, it means the number is too large to be displayed, so it prints an error message.

   - The `[ DIV 10 + SWAP 48 + ] WHILE` loop repeatedly divides the number by 10, adds 48 (the ASCII code for '0') to the remainder, and swaps the top two stack items. This converts the number into a character string representation.

   - The `DUP 0 <`: Duplicates the top stack item and checks if it is less than 0. If it is, it means the number is still negative, so it prints a minus sign.

   - The `[ 48 + ] EACH TYPE` loop iterates through the character string representation of the number, adding 48 to each character code and printing the resulting character. This effectively prints the number as a character string.

10. Finally, the `START ;` at the end of the code terminates the definition of the `START` word.
