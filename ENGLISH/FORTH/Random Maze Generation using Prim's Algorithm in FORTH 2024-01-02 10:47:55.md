Sure! Here's a complex code in FORTH:

This code generates a random maze using Prim's algorithm. It creates a grid of cells and connects them by removing walls between adjacent cells. The `random` word generates a random number, `cell` calculates the memory address of a cell, `neighbors` randomly selects one of the neighboring cells, `in-maze?` checks if a cell is already in the maze, `wall?` checks if there is a wall between two cells, `remove-wall` removes the wall between two cells, `add-to-maze` adds a cell to the maze, `valid-cell?` checks if a cell is within the maze boundaries, `maze-generated?` checks if the maze generation is complete, `generate-maze` generates the maze using Prim's algorithm, `print-maze` prints the maze, `solve-maze` solves the maze by printing the path, and `main` is the entry point of the program where the maze generation and printing occur.

You can run this code in a FORTH interpreter to see the generated maze.
