Certainly! Here's a complex and differentiated code in FORTH:

```forth
: fibonacci ( n -- n1 )
    dup 2 < if drop 1 else
        dup 1 - recurse swap 2 - recurse +
    then ;

: factorial ( n -- n! )
    dup 1 <= if drop 1 else
        dup 1 - recurse *
    then ;

: print-fibonacci-factorial ( n -- )
    ." Fibonacci series up to n: " cr
    0 swap 0 do i fibonacci . loop cr
    ." Factorials up to n: " cr
    0 swap 0 do i factorial . loop ;

: main
    ." Please enter a number: " ? cr
    begin
        key decimal dup 10 = if drop exit then
    until drop
    print-fibonacci-factorial ;

main
```

This code showcases three different FORTH words (functions) that perform different calculations.

1. The `fibonacci` word calculates the nth Fibonacci number recursively. It takes a single input argument `n` and returns `n1`, the nth Fibonacci number. It uses a simple if-else construct to handle base cases where `n` is less than 2.

2. The `factorial` word calculates the factorial of a given number `n` recursively. It takes `n` as input and returns `n!`, the factorial of `n`. Similar to the `fibonacci` word, it uses an if-else construct to handle the base case where `n` is less than or equal to 1.

3. The `print-fibonacci-factorial` word demonstrates the usage of `fibonacci` and `factorial` words. It takes a number `n` as input and prints the Fibonacci series up to `n` as well as the factorials up to `n`. It uses a loop construct to iterate from 0 to `n`.

4. The `main` word is the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to enter a number, reads the input until a decimal digit is provided, and then calls the `print-fibonacci-factorial` word with the entered number.

Overall, this code showcases how FORTH can handle recursion, conditional statements, loops, and user input/output.
