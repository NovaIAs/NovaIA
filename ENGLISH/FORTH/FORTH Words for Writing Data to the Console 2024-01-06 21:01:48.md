This code is a collection of Forth words for writing various data types to the console. It includes functions for writing bytes, words, double words, cells, double cells, strings, numbers, and more. Each function takes the address and size of the data to be written as its input, and writes it to the console using the appropriate format.

Here is an example of how to use these words:

```forth
10 PRINT-PRIME-NUMBERS
```

This will print the first 10 prime numbers to the console.

```forth
"Hello, world!" WRITE-STRING-CR
```

This will print the string "Hello, world!" to the console, followed by a carriage return.

```forth
12345 WRITE-NUMBER-CR
```

This will print the number 12345 to the console, followed by a carriage return.

```forth
0x1234ABCD WRITE-DOUBLE-WORD-CR
```

This will print the double word 0x1234ABCD to the console, followed by a carriage return.
