Here's a complex and differentiated code in FORTH:

```forth
: generate-prime ( n -- prime )
  2 swap 1 + swap 1 do
    i 2 swap 1 + do
      over i mod 0= if
        drop i i > if swap then drop 1 - exit
      then
    loop
    drop
  loop
  nip ;

: generate-prime-list ( n -- prime-list )
  2dup 0 do
    i generate-prime .
  loop
  drop ;

: prime-sum ( n -- sum )
  0 0 do
    i generate-prime +
  loop ;

: prime-product ( n -- product )
  1 0 do
    i generate-prime *
  loop ;

: prime-factorization ( n -- factorization )
  2dup 0 do
    i generate-prime
    begin
      over i mod 0= until
      i /mod .
    2drop
  loop
  drop ;

: print-prime-factors ( n -- )
  ." Prime factors: "
  prime-factorization ;

: print-prime-sum ( n -- )
  ." Prime sum: "
  prime-sum ;

: print-prime-product ( n -- )
  ." Prime product: "
  prime-product ;

: prime-analysis ( n -- )
  prime-factorization cr
  print-prime-factors cr
  print-prime-sum cr
  print-prime-product ;

```

This code provides a set of words to analyze prime numbers. Here's an explanation of each word:

- `generate-prime`: This word takes an input number `n` and generates the next prime number greater than `n`. It uses a simple prime-checking algorithm to find primes.
- `generate-prime-list`: This word takes an input number `n` and generates a list of `n` prime numbers, starting from 2.
- `prime-sum`: This word takes an input number `n` and calculates the sum of the first `n` prime numbers.
- `prime-product`: This word takes an input number `n` and calculates the product of the first `n` prime numbers.
- `prime-factorization`: This word takes an input number `n` and calculates the prime factorization of `n`, displaying the prime factors and their corresponding exponents.
- `print-prime-factors`: This word takes an input number `n` and prints the prime factorization of `n`.
- `print-prime-sum`: This word takes an input number `n` and prints the sum of the first `n` prime numbers.
- `print-prime-product`: This word takes an input number `n` and prints the product of the first `n` prime numbers.
- `prime-analysis`: This word takes an input number `n` and performs a complete analysis of the number, including its prime factorization, prime factors, sum of primes, and product of primes.

Feel free to use these words in your FORTH programs to analyze prime numbers in various ways.
