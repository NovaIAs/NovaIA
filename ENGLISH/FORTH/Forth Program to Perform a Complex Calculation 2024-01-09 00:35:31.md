Explanation:

1. `big-code`: This is a Forth word that defines a complex calculation. It takes four numbers (a, b, c, and d) as input and performs a series of operations on them. The result of the calculation is left on the stack.

2. The calculation inside the `big-code` word is performed using a `[ ... ] repeat` loop. This loop executes a series of Forth words repeatedly until the stack is empty.

3. The words inside the loop perform the following operations:

   - `swap`: Swaps the top two items on the stack.
   - `drop`: Drops the top item from the stack.
   - `over`: Copies the top item on the stack to the top of the stack.
   - `rot`: Rotates the top three items on the stack.
   - `-`: Subtracts the top two items on the stack.
   - `+`: Adds the top two items on the stack.
   - `*`: Multiplies the top two items on the stack.

4. After the loop is finished, the result of the calculation is left on the stack.

5. `print-result`: This is a Forth word that prints the value of the top item on the stack.

6. The final part of the code uses the `big-code` and `print-result` words to perform the calculation and print the result. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are passed as input to the `big-code` word, and the result is printed using the `print-result` word.
