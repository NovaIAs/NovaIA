This code implements a variety of mathematical functions in FORTH, including Fibonacci, factorial, greatest common divisor (GCD), prime number checking, finding the next prime number, perfect number checking, prime factorization, the Collatz conjecture, and a tree printing function.

Here's a brief explanation of each function:

- `FIBONACCI`: Computes the Fibonacci sequence up to the given number.

- `FACTORIAL`: Calculates the factorial of the given number.

- `GCD`: Finds the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

- `IS-PRIME`: Checks if the given number is prime.

- `NEXT-PRIME`: Finds the next prime number after the given number.

- `PERFECT-NUMBER`: Checks if the given number is a perfect number.

- `PRIME-FACTOR`: Finds the prime factors of the given number.

- `COLLATZ`: Applies the Collatz conjecture to the given number, generating a sequence of numbers.

- `TREE-PRT`: Prints a tree structure represented as a list of lists.

These functions demonstrate the versatility and power of FORTH for mathematical operations and data manipulation.
