This is a very large and differentiated code in FORTH. It contains many different functions, each of which is explained below.

* **IF-THEN:** This function takes two arguments, a condition and a body. If the condition is true, the body is executed. Otherwise, the body is skipped.
* **IF-THEN-ELSE:** This function takes three arguments, a condition, a body for the true case, and a body for the false case. If the condition is true, the body for the true case is executed. Otherwise, the body for the false case is executed.
* **CASE:** This function takes a list of pairs, where each pair consists of a value and a body. The value of the first pair is compared to the value of the argument. If they are equal, the body of the first pair is executed. Otherwise, the value of the second pair is compared to the value of the argument. This process continues until a match is found. If no match is found, the body of the last pair is executed.
* **WHILE:** This function takes a body and executes it repeatedly until the body returns false.
* **UNTIL:** This function takes a body and executes it repeatedly until the body returns true.
* **FOR:** This function takes a body and a number of iterations. The body is executed the specified number of times.
* **FOR-EACH:** This function takes a body and a list. The body is executed for each element in the list.
* **MAP:** This function takes a body and a list. The body is executed for each element in the list, and the results are collected into a new list.
* **REDUCE:** This function takes a body and a list. The body is executed for each element in the list, and the results are combined using a specified operator.
* **FIND:** This function takes a body and a list. The body is executed for each element in the list, and the first element for which the body returns true is returned.
* **SELECT:** This function takes a body and a list. The body is executed for each element in the list, and the elements for which the body returns true are collected into a new list.
* **REJECT:** This function takes a body and a list. The body is executed for each element in the list, and the elements for which the body returns false are collected into a new list.
* **PARTITION:** This function takes a body and a list. The body is executed for each element in the list, and the elements for which the body returns true are collected into a new list. The elements for which the body returns false are collected into another new list.
* **SORT:** This function takes a body and a list. The body is executed for each pair of elements in the list, and the elements are swapped if the body returns true. The function continues to execute until the list is sorted.
* **REVERSE:** This function takes a body and a list. The body is executed for each pair of elements in the list, and the elements are swapped. The function continues to execute until the list is reversed.
* **ROTATE:** This function takes a body and a list. The body is executed for each triple of elements in the list, and the elements are rotated. The function continues to execute until the list is rotated.
* **SWAP:** This function takes a body and a list. The body is executed for each pair of elements in the list, and the elements are swapped. The function continues to execute until the list is swapped.
* **DROP:** This function takes a body and a list. The body is executed for each element in the list, and the element is removed from the list. The function continues to execute until the list is empty.
* **OVER:** This function takes a body and a list. The body is executed for each pair of elements in the list, and the second element is copied to the top of the list. The function continues to execute until the list is empty.
* **DUP:** This function takes a body and a list. The body is executed for each element in the list, and the element is copied to the top of the list. The function continues to execute until the list is empty.
* **NIP:** This function takes a body and a list. The body is executed for each pair of elements in the list, and the second element is removed from the list. The function continues to execute until the list is empty.
* **TUCK:** This function takes a body and a list. The body is executed for each pair of elements in the list, and the second element is copied to the top of the list. The first element is then copied to the top of the list. The function continues to execute until the list is empty.
* **PICK:** This function takes a body and a list. The body is executed for each pair of elements in the list, and the second element is copied to the top of the list. The first element is then removed from the list. The function continues to execute until the list is empty.
* **ROLL:** This function takes a body and a list. The body is executed for each triple of elements in the list, and the elements are rotated. The function continues to execute until the list is rotated.
* **EXECUTE:** This function takes a body and a
