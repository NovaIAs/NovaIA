This code simulates a game of poker. It defines a case class to represent a playing card, and then creates a deck of cards by combining all possible ranks and suits. The deck is then shuffled and dealt to four players. A function is defined to determine the winner of a hand of cards, and the winners of each hand are printed.

The code is complex because it involves working with lists, maps, and functions. It also uses a number of Scala features, such as case classes, for-comprehensions, and pattern matching.

Here are some explanations of the code:

* The `Card` case class is used to represent a playing card. It has two fields: `rank` and `suit`.
* The `ranks` and `suits` lists contain all possible card ranks and suits.
* The `deck` variable is created by using a for-comprehension to combine all possible ranks and suits.
* The `shuffledDeck` variable is created by shuffling the deck of cards.
* The `hands` variable is created by dealing 5 cards to each player.
* The `determineWinner` function is used to determine the winner of a hand of cards. It groups the cards by rank, finds the rank that occurs the most times, and then finds the cards that have the most common rank. If there is only one winning card, the player who has it wins. If there are multiple winning cards, the winner is determined based on the suit of the cards.
* The `winners` variable is created by applying the `determineWinner` function to each hand.
* The winners of each hand are printed using a foreach loop.
