Explanation:

- The `Person` case class represents a person with a name and an age.
- The `createPeopleList` function creates a list of people with different names and ages.
- The `printNames` function prints the names of the people in a list.
- The `findOldestPerson` function finds the oldest person in a list by comparing their ages.
- The `calculateAverageAge` function calculates the average age of the people in a list by summing their ages and dividing by the number of people.
- The `groupPeopleByAge` function groups the people in a list by their age, returning a map where the keys are the ages and the values are lists of people with that age.
- The `sortPeopleByName` function sorts the people in a list by their name, returning a new list of people.

The last lines of the code:

- Create a list of people by calling the `createPeopleList` function.
- Print the names of the people in the list by calling the `printNames` function.
- Find the oldest person in the list by calling the `findOldestPerson` function and print their name.
- Calculate the average age of the people in the list by calling the `calculateAverageAge` function and print the result.
- Group the people in the list by their age by calling the `groupPeopleByAge` function and print the result.
- Sort the people in the list by their name by calling the `sortPeopleByName` function and print the result.
