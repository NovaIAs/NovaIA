**Explanation:**

This Scala code demonstrates a more complex and differentiated approach to solving a problem. It focuses on calculating the area of different shapes based on user input. Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

1. **Define a Sealed Trait for Shape:**
   - A sealed trait `Shape` is defined to represent different types of shapes. This ensures that only specific subclasses of `Shape` can be created.

2. **Define Case Classes for Shape Types:**
   - Three case classes, `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle`, are defined as subclasses of `Shape`. Each case class represents a specific type of shape with its own properties.

3. **Define a Function to Calculate Area:**
   - A function `calculateArea` is defined to calculate the area of a shape. It takes a `Shape` object as input and returns the area based on the shape's properties.

4. **Define a Function to Print Area:**
   - A function `printArea` is defined to print the area of a shape. It takes a `Shape` object as input and prints the calculated area.

5. **Define a Function to Create Shape:**
   - A function `createShape` is defined to take input from the user and create a `Shape` object based on the user's choice. It prompts the user to enter the type of shape and the necessary dimensions.

6. **Define the Main Method:**
   - The `main` method is defined as the entry point of the program. It calls the `createShape` function to obtain a `Shape` object based on user input. Then, it calls the `printArea` function to display the area of the shape.

This code demonstrates the use of sealed traits, case classes, pattern matching, and user input handling in Scala to solve a problem involving different types of shapes and their areas.
