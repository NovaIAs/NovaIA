This code prints a greeting to the user. It first asks the user for their name using the `println!` macro. Then, it uses the `io::stdin()` function to read a line of text from the standard input stream. The `read_line()` method reads a line of text and stores it in the `name` variable. The `&mut` operator is used to pass the `name` variable as a mutable reference, which allows the `read_line()` method to write to the variable.

After the user enters their name, the code uses the `println!` macro to print a greeting to the user. The `&` operator is used to reference the `name` variable, and the `.trim()` method is used to remove any whitespace characters from the string. The `, ` and `!` characters are used to format the greeting.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

* The `use` statement brings the `println!` macro into scope. The `println!` macro is a built-in Rust macro that is used to print a string to the console.
* The `main` function is the entry point of the program. Rust programs must have a `main` function.
* The `let` statement declares a variable. The `mut` keyword makes the variable mutable. A mutable variable can be changed after it has been declared.
* The `String::new()` function creates a new empty string. The `name` variable is assigned to the empty string.
* The `println!` macro is used to print a string to the console. The `&` operator is used to reference the variable `name`. The `What is your name?` string is printed to the console.
* The `io::stdin()` function returns a handle to the standard input stream. The standard input stream is the input that is provided by the user.
* The `read_line()` method reads a line of text from the standard input stream. The `&mut` operator is used to pass the `name` variable as a mutable reference. The `read_line()` method writes the line of text to the `name` variable.
* The `println!` macro is used to print a string to the console. The `&` operator is used to reference the `name` variable. The `.trim()` method is used to remove any whitespace characters from the string. The `, ` and `!` characters are used to format the greeting.

This code is a simple example of how to use Rust to print a greeting to the user.
