This code is a program that takes a string of text from the user and counts the occurrences of each word in the text. The program uses a tokenizer to tokenize the input text into words, and then uses a word counter to count the occurrences of each word. The program then prints the word map, which shows the words and their counts.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The `Word` struct defines the structure for a word, which includes the word itself and the number of occurrences of the word.
* The `WordMap` struct defines the structure for a word map, which is a collection of words and their counts.
* The `Tokenizer` struct defines the tokenizer, which is responsible for tokenizing a given string. The tokenizer uses a list of stop words to remove common words from the input text before tokenizing it.
* The `WordCounter` struct defines the word counter, which is responsible for counting the occurrences of words in a given text. The word counter uses a hash map to store the word counts.
* The `main` function is the entry point for the program. The `main` function reads the input text from the user, creates a tokenizer and a word counter, and then prints the word map.

This code is a more complex example of a program written in Rust. It demonstrates the use of structs, hash maps, and other features of the Rust programming language.
