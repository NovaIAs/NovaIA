```rust
// This is a Rust program that implements a simple chat server.

// Import the necessary libraries.
use std::io::{self, BufRead, BufWriter, Write};
use std::net::{TcpListener, TcpStream};
use std::thread;

// Define the main function.
fn main() {
    // Create a new TcpListener object.
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080").unwrap();

    // Accept incoming connections.
    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        // Spawn a new thread to handle each connection.
        thread::spawn(move || {
            // Get the TcpStream object.
            let stream = stream.unwrap();

            // Create a BufReader and BufWriter objects.
            let mut reader = BufReader::new(&stream);
            let mut writer = BufWriter::new(&stream);

            // Read the client's message.
            let mut message = String::new();
            reader.read_line(&mut message).unwrap();

            // Write a response to the client.
            writer.write_all(b"Hello, world!\n").unwrap();
            writer.flush().unwrap();

            // Close the connection.
            stream.shutdown(std::net::Shutdown::Both).unwrap();
        });
    }
}
```

This code is a simple chat server that listens on port 8080 and accepts incoming connections. For each connection, it spawns a new thread to handle the communication. The thread reads the client's message, writes a response, and then closes the connection.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

* The `use` statements at the beginning of the program import the necessary libraries.
* The `main` function is the entry point for the program.
* The `TcpListener::bind` function creates a new TcpListener object that listens on the specified address and port.
* The `for` loop accepts incoming connections.
* The `thread::spawn` function spawns a new thread to handle each connection.
* The `BufReader` and `BufWriter` objects are used to read and write data to the stream.
* The `read_line` function reads a line of text from the stream.
* The `write_all` function writes data to the stream.
* The `flush` function flushes the buffer to the stream.
* The `shutdown` function closes the connection.

This code is a good example of how to use Rust to write a simple network application.
