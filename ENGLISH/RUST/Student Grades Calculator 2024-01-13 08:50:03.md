This code is a complex program that reads the names and grades of students from the console and calculates the average grade for each student. The program uses a HashMap to store the names of the students and their grades, and a HashSet to store the names of the students who have taken the exam. The program also uses a loop to read the input from the console, and a conditional statement to check if the user wants to continue or quit. The program then calculates the average grade for each student and prints the names of the students and their average grades to the console.

This code is complex because it uses a number of different data structures and algorithms. It also uses a loop and a conditional statement to control the flow of the program. The program is also written in a modular way, with each function performing a specific task. This makes the code easier to read and understand.
