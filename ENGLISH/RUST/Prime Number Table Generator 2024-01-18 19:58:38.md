Explanation:

* The program starts by importing the necessary libraries.
* The `main` function is defined, which is the entry point of the program.
* The user is prompted to enter the limit up to which prime numbers should be generated.
* A hash set is created to store the prime numbers.
* A loop is used to iterate over the numbers from 2 to the limit.
* For each number, the `is_prime` function is called to check if it is prime.
* If the number is prime, it is added to the hash set.
* After the loop has finished, the table of prime numbers is printed.
* The `is_prime` function is defined, which takes a number as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the number is prime.
* The function first checks if the number is 1, in which case it is not prime.
* If the number is not 1, the function iterates over the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number.
* If the number is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.
* If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.
