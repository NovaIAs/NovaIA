// This is a function declaration. The `fn` keyword indicates that this is a function. The `main` keyword indicates that this is the main function of the program. The `()` after the function name indicates that the function takes no arguments. The `->` indicates the return type of the function. In this case, the return type is `()`, which means that the function does not return any value.

fn main() {
    // This is a variable declaration. The `let` keyword indicates that this is a variable. The `mut` keyword indicates that the variable is mutable, meaning that its value can be changed. The `x` is the name of the variable. The `:` indicates the type of the variable. In this case, the type of the variable is `i32`, which is a 32-bit integer. The `=` assigns the value of `10` to the variable `x`.

    let mut x: i32 = 10;

    // This is a loop. The `while` keyword indicates that this is a loop. The `x > 0` condition indicates that the loop will continue as long as the value of `x` is greater than `0`.

        // This is a print statement. The `println!` macro is used to print a message to the console. The `{}` indicates a placeholder for a variable. The `x` after the placeholder is the variable that will be printed.

        println!("The value of x is: {}", x);

        // This is a decrement operator. The `x -= 1` statement subtracts `1` from the value of `x`.

        x -= 1;
    }

    // This is a conditional statement. The `if` keyword indicates that this is a conditional statement. The `x == 0` condition indicates that the statement will be executed if the value of `x` is equal to `0`.

        println!("The value of x is now 0.");
    }

```

This code is a bit more complex than the previous code. It includes a function, a loop, a conditional statement, and a decrement operator.

The code first declares a variable called `x` and assigns it the value of `10`. Then, it enters a loop that continues as long as the value of `x` is greater than `0`. Inside the loop, the code prints the value of `x` to the console and then subtracts `1` from the value of `x`.

After the loop, the code uses a conditional statement to check if the value of `x` is equal to `0`. If it is, the code prints a message to the console.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* **Function declaration:**

```rust
fn main() {
```

This line declares the `main` function. The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It is called when the program starts.

* **Variable declaration:**

```rust
let mut x: i32 = 10;
```

This line declares a variable called `x`. The `let` keyword indicates that this is a variable. The `mut` keyword indicates that the variable is mutable, meaning that its value can be changed. The `x` is the name of the variable. The `:` indicates the type of the variable. In this case, the type of the variable is `i32`, which is a 32-bit integer. The `=` assigns the value of `10` to the variable `x`.

* **Loop:**

```rust
while x > 0 {
```

This line starts a loop. The `while` keyword indicates that this is a loop. The `x > 0` condition indicates that the loop will continue as long as the value of `x` is greater than `0`.

* **Print statement:**

```rust
println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
```

This line prints the value of `x` to the console. The `println!` macro is used to print a message to the console. The `{}` indicates a placeholder for a variable. The `x` after the placeholder is the variable that will be printed.

* **Decrement operator:**

```rust
x -= 1;
```

This line decrements the value of `x`. The `-=` operator is a shortcut for `x = x - 1`.

* **Conditional statement:**

```rust
if x == 0 {
```

This line starts a conditional statement. The `if` keyword indicates that this is a conditional statement. The `x == 0` condition indicates that the statement will be executed if the value of `x` is equal to `0`.

* **Print statement:**

```rust
println!("The value of x is now 0.");
```

This line prints a message to the console.
