```rust
// This code implements a simple calculator.

// First, we import the necessary libraries.
use std::io;
use std::fmt;

// Then, we define the enum that will represent the different operations.
enum Operation {
    Add,
    Subtract,
    Multiply,
    Divide,
}

// Next, we define the struct that will represent the calculator.
struct Calculator {
    // The current value of the calculator.
    value: f64,
    // The last operation that was performed.
    operation: Option<Operation>,
}

// Then, we implement the methods for the calculator.
impl Calculator {
    // This method creates a new calculator with a value of 0 and no operation.
    fn new() -> Calculator {
        Calculator {
            value: 0.0,
            operation: None,

    fn add(&mut self, number: f64) {
        self.value += number;

    fn subtract(&mut self, number: f64) {

    // This method multiplies two numbers.
    fn multiply(&mut self, number: f64) {

        self.operation = Some(Operation::Divide);
    }

    // This method prints the current value of the calculator.
    fn print(&self) {
        println!("The current value is {}", self.value);

}

// Finally, we create a main function that will use the calculator.
fn main() {
    // First, we create a new calculator.
    let mut calculator = Calculator::new();

    // Then, we read the input from the user.
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();

    // Next, we parse the input into a number.
    let number = input.trim().parse::<f64>().unwrap();

    // Then, we perform the operation on the calculator.
    calculator.add(number);

    // Finally, we print the current value of the calculator.

```
This code is a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers. The calculator is implemented as a struct with a value and an operation field. The operation field is an enum that represents the different operations that the calculator can perform. The calculator has four methods: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. These methods take a number as an argument and perform the corresponding operation on the calculator's value. The calculator also has a print method that prints the current value of the calculator.

The main function creates a new calculator and then reads the input from the user. The input is parsed into a number and then the calculator performs the corresponding operation on the value. Finally, the calculator prints the current value of the calculator.
