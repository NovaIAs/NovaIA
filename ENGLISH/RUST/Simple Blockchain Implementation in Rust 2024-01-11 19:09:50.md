This code implements a simple blockchain in Rust. The blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions between two parties in a secure and tamper-proof manner. The blockchain is made up of a series of blocks, each of which contains a list of transactions. The blocks are linked together in a chain, with each block referencing the previous block. This makes it very difficult to tamper with the blockchain, as any changes to a block would also require changes to all of the subsequent blocks.

The `Blockchain` struct represents the blockchain itself. It contains a vector of blocks, and a reference to the previous block. The `Block` struct represents a single block in the blockchain. It contains a hash of the block, a timestamp, and a list of transactions. The `Transaction` struct represents a single transaction in the blockchain. It contains the sender's address, the receiver's address, and the amount of money being transferred.

The `create_genesis_block` function creates the first block in the blockchain. The genesis block is special because it does not have a previous block. The `calculate_hash` function calculates the cryptographic hash of a block. The hash is used to uniquely identify the block in the blockchain. The `add_block` function adds a new block to the blockchain. The block is added to the end of the blockchain, and the previous block is updated to point to the new block.

The `is_valid_block` function checks if a block is valid. A block is valid if its hash is equal to the hash of the previous block, and if all of its transactions are valid. The `is_valid_transaction` function checks if a transaction is valid. A transaction is valid if the sender has enough money to send the amount being transferred.

The `main` function is the entry point for the program. It creates a new blockchain, adds some blocks to it, and then checks if the blockchain is valid.
