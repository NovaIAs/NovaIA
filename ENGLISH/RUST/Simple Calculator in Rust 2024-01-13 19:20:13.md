This code implements a simple calculator in Rust. The calculator has a state, which is represented by a String. The calculator can be given a command, which is also a String. The calculator can perform the following operations:

* Add two numbers
* Subtract two numbers
* Multiply two numbers
* Divide two numbers
* Reset the calculator to its initial state
* Quit the program

The calculator is implemented using a struct, which is a data structure that can hold multiple related values. The struct has a single field, `state`, which is a String. The calculator also implements the `CalculatorTrait` trait, which defines the operations that can be performed on the calculator.

The `main` function creates a new calculator and then repeatedly prompts the user for commands. The user can enter any of the commands listed above. The calculator will then perform the appropriate operation and print its state.

This code is a good example of how to use structs and traits in Rust. It is also a good example of how to write a simple command-line program.
