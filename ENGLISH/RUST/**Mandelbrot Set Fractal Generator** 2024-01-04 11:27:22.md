```rust
// This is a Rust program that generates a fractal image using the Mandelbrot set.

// The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers with a fractal boundary that has been described as "the most complex object in mathematics".
// The set is defined by the following equation:
//
// z = z^2 + c
//
// where c is a complex number.
//
// If the value of z remains bounded as n approaches infinity, then c is in the Mandelbrot set.
// Otherwise, c is not in the Mandelbrot set.

// This program uses a complex number library to generate the Mandelbrot set.
// The complex number library is used to represent the complex numbers c and z.
// The program also uses a graphics library to generate the fractal image.
// The graphics library is used to draw the pixels in the image.

// The program first creates a complex number object to represent the complex number c.
// The program then uses a for loop to iterate over the values of c in the complex plane.
// For each value of c, the program uses the complex number library to calculate the value of z.
// The program then uses a conditional statement to determine if c is in the Mandelbrot set.
// If c is in the Mandelbrot set, the program uses the graphics library to draw a pixel in the image.

// The program repeats this process for all of the values of c in the complex plane.
// When the program is finished, the fractal image is displayed on the screen.

// Here is the code for the program:

use complex::{Complex, ComplexNumber};
use graphics::{Image, Point, Renderer};

fn main() {
    // Create a complex number object to represent the complex number c.
    let c = ComplexNumber::new(0.0, 0.0);

    // Create a graphics object to generate the fractal image.
    let mut image = Image::new(800, 600);

    // Use a for loop to iterate over the values of c in the complex plane.
    for x in 0..800 {
        for y in 0..600 {
            // Calculate the value of z for the current value of c.
            let z = c.pow(2) + ComplexNumber::new(x as f64, y as f64);

            // Determine if c is in the Mandelbrot set.
            if z.abs() < 2.0 {
                // Draw a pixel in the image.
                image.draw_pixel(Point::new(x, y), Color::Black);
            }
        }
    }

    // Display the fractal image on the screen.
    image.display();
}
```

**Explanation:**

* The `complex` module is used to represent complex numbers.
* The `graphics` module is used to generate the fractal image.
* The `main` function is the entry point of the program.
* The `for` loops are used to iterate over the values of c in the complex plane.
* The `if` statement is used to determine if c is in the Mandelbrot set.
* The `draw_pixel` method is used to draw a pixel in the image.
* The `display` method is used to display the fractal image on the screen.
