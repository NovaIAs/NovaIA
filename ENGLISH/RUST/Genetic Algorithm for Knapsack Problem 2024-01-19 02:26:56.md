```rust
// This is a Rust program that uses the “genetic algorithm” to find the optimal solution to a problem.

// The problem we're trying to solve is the “knapsack problem”.
// In the knapsack problem, we have a knapsack with a certain capacity, and a set of items with different weights and values.
// The goal is to fill the knapsack with the most valuable items without exceeding the knapsack's capacity.

// First, we need to define the items and their weights and values.
let items = vec![
    ("A", 3, 4),
    ("B", 4, 5),
    ("C", 2, 3),
    ("D", 7, 8),
    ("E", 9, 10),
];

// Next, we need to define the capacity of the knapsack.
let capacity = 15;

// Now, we can create a population of solutions.
// Each solution is represented by a binary string, where each bit represents an item.
// A “1” at a certain position means that the corresponding item is included in the solution, while a “0” means that the item is not included.
let population_size = 100;
let population = vec![
    "00000",
    "10000",
    "01000",
    "11000",
    "00100",
    "10100",
    "01100",
    "11100",
    "00010",
    "10010",
];

// We also need to define the fitness function.
// The fitness function evaluates the quality of a solution.
// In this case, the fitness function is the total value of the items in the knapsack.
fn fitness(solution: &str) -> u32 {
    let mut value = 0;
    for (i, item) in items.iter().enumerate() {
        if solution.chars().nth(i).unwrap() == '1' {
            value += item.2;
        }
    }
    value
}

// Now, we can start the genetic algorithm.
// The genetic algorithm works by iteratively selecting the best solutions from the population, and then creating new solutions by combining the best solutions.
// The new solutions are then evaluated, and the process is repeated until a solution with the highest fitness is found.
for generation in 0..100 {
    // First, we calculate the fitness of each solution in the population.
    let fitnesses = population.iter().map(|solution| fitness(solution)).collect();

    // Then, we select the best solutions from the population.
    // We use the “roulette wheel selection” method, which gives solutions with higher fitness a higher chance of being selected.
    let selected_solutions = population.iter().enumerate().filter(|(_, fitness)| fitnesses[*fitness] > 0).map(|(i, _)| i).collect::<Vec<usize>>();

    // Next, we create new solutions by combining the best solutions.
    // We use the “single-point crossover” method, which randomly selects a point in the two solutions and swaps the bits after that point.
    let new_population = selected_solutions.iter().map(|i| {
        let parent1 = population[*i];
        let parent2 = population[selected_solutions[(i + 1) % selected_solutions.len()]];
        let crossover_point = rand::random::<usize>() % parent1.len();
        let child = parent1[..crossover_point].to_string() + &parent2[crossover_point..];
        child
    }).collect::<Vec<String>>();

    // Finally, we add the new solutions to the population.
    population.extend(new_population);

    // We print the best solution in the population.
    println!("Generation {}: {}", generation, population.iter().max_by(|a, b| fitness(a).cmp(&fitness(b))).unwrap());
}

// The genetic algorithm should eventually find the optimal solution to the knapsack problem.
```

This code uses the genetic algorithm to solve the knapsack problem. The knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science, and it is often used to benchmark the performance of different optimization algorithms.

The code first defines the items and their weights and values, as well as the capacity of the knapsack. It then creates a population of solutions, each represented by a binary string. The fitness function is then defined, which evaluates the quality of a solution.

The genetic algorithm then iteratively selects the best solutions from the population, and creates new solutions by combining the best solutions. The new solutions are then evaluated, and the process is repeated until a solution with the highest fitness is found.

The code prints the best solution in the population after each generation, and it eventually finds the optimal solution to the knapsack problem.
