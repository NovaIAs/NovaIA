Here is a complex Rust code that is unlikely to be repeated again:

```rust
// Import the necessary libraries.
use std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet};
use std::hash::Hash;
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

// Define the main function.
fn main() {
    // Read the input from the console.
    let lines = io::stdin().lock().lines().map(|line| line.unwrap()).collect::<Vec<String>>();

    // Parse the input into a graph.
    let graph: HashMap<&str, HashSet<&str>> = lines.iter().map(|line| {
        let mut parts = line.split('-');
        let from = parts.next().unwrap();
        let to = parts.next().unwrap();
        (from, HashSet::from([to]))
    }).collect();

    // Add the reverse edges to the graph.
    for (from, to) in graph.iter_mut() {
        to.insert(from);
    }

    // Define the function to find all paths in the graph.
    fn find_all_paths<'a>(graph: &'a HashMap<&'a str, HashSet<&'a str>>, start: &'a str, end: &'a str, visited: &mut HashSet<&'a str>, paths: &mut Vec<Vec<&'a str>>) {
        // Add the current node to the visited set.
        visited.insert(start);

        // If the current node is the end node, add the path to the list of paths.
        if start == end {
            paths.push(visited.iter().cloned().collect());
        } else {
            // Otherwise, recursively find all paths from the current node to the end node.
            for neighbor in graph[start].iter() {
                if !visited.contains(neighbor) {
                    find_all_paths(graph, neighbor, end, visited, paths);
                }
            }
        }

        // Remove the current node from the visited set.
        visited.remove(start);
    }

    // Find all paths from the start node to the end node.
    let mut visited = HashSet::new();
    let mut paths = Vec::new();
    find_all_paths(&graph, "start", "end", &mut visited, &mut paths);

    // Print the number of paths found.
    println!("There are {} paths from start to end.", paths.len());

    // Print the paths found.
    for path in paths {
        println!("{:?}", path);
    }
}
```

This code is a complex implementation of a graph traversal algorithm that finds all paths from a start node to an end node in a graph. The graph is represented as a HashMap, where the keys are the nodes of the graph and the values are HashSet objects containing the neighbors of each node.

The find_all_paths function uses a recursive algorithm to find all paths from the start node to the end node. The function takes the following parameters:

* graph: The graph to be searched.
* start: The start node of the path.
* end: The end node of the path.
* visited: A HashSet object containing the nodes that have been visited so far.
* paths: A Vec object containing the paths that have been found so far.

The function works by first adding the current node to the visited set. If the current node is the end node, then the path is added to the list of paths. Otherwise, the function recursively finds all paths from the current node to the end node. After all paths have been found, the function removes the current node from the visited set.

The main function reads the input from the console and parses it into a graph. The main function then calls the find_all_paths function to find all paths from the start node to the end node. The main function then prints the number of paths found and the paths themselves.
