Explanation:

1. **Import Necessary Crates**: We import the necessary crates, including the `std` crate for standard library functions, the `collections::HashMap` for storing word frequencies, and the `fs::File` and `io::BufRead` for reading the file.

2. **Define the `WordFrequency` Struct**: We define a `WordFrequency` struct to represent a word and its frequency. This struct has two fields: `word` (a `String`) and `frequency` (a `usize`).

3. **Define the `read_file` Function**: This function takes a file path as input and returns a list of words. It opens the file in read-only mode, reads each line of the file, and splits each line into words using the `split_whitespace` method. It then converts all the words to lowercase and collects them into a list.

4. **Define the `count_word_frequencies` Function**: This function takes a list of words as input and returns a HashMap of word frequencies. It iterates over the words and updates the frequency of each word in the HashMap. If a word is not in the HashMap, its frequency is initialized to 0.

5. **Define the `sort_word_frequencies` Function**: This function takes a HashMap of word frequencies as input and returns a vector of `WordFrequency` structs sorted in descending order by frequency. It converts the HashMap into a vector of `WordFrequency` structs and then sorts the vector using the `sort_by` method.

6. **Define the `print_top_n_words` Function**: This function takes a vector of `WordFrequency` structs and an integer `n` as input and prints the top `n` most frequent words. It iterates over the first `n` elements of the vector and prints the word, its frequency, and its rank.

7. **Define the `main` Function**: The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It gets the file path from the user, reads the file and gets a list of words, counts the frequency of each word, sorts the word frequencies in descending order, and prints the top 10 most frequent words.
