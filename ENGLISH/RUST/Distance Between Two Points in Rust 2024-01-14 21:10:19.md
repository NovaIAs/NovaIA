```rust
// This code defines a struct called `Point` with two fields: `x` and `y`, both of type `f64`.
// The `#[derive(Debug)]` attribute lets us print the struct using `println!("{:?}", point)`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

// This code defines a function called `distance` that takes two `Point` structs as input and returns the distance between them.
fn distance(p1: &Point, p2: &Point) -> f64 {
    // We use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance between the two points.
    ((p2.x - p1.x).powf(2.0) + (p2.y - p1.y).powf(2.0)).sqrt()
}

// This code defines a function called `main` that is the entry point for the program.
fn main() {
    // We create two `Point` structs, `p1` and `p2`.
    let p1 = Point { x: 1.0, y: 2.0 };
    let p2 = Point { x: 4.0, y: 6.0 };

    // We call the `distance` function to calculate the distance between the two points and print it to the console.
    println!("The distance between the two points is: {}", distance(&p1, &p2));
}
```

This code demonstrates several key concepts in Rust:

1. **Structs**: Structs are used to define custom types with named fields. In this code, we define a `Point` struct with two fields, `x` and `y`, both of type `f64`.

2. **Attributes**: Attributes are used to provide additional information about a code element. In this code, we use the `#[derive(Debug)]` attribute to derive a `Debug` implementation for the `Point` struct. This allows us to print the struct using `println!("{:?}", point)`.

3. **Functions**: Functions are used to define reusable blocks of code. In this code, we define a function called `distance` that takes two `Point` structs as input and returns the distance between them.

4. **Function Parameters**: Function parameters are used to pass values to a function. In this code, the `distance` function takes two `&Point` parameters, which are references to `Point` structs. This allows us to pass the `Point` structs to the function without copying them, which is more efficient.

5. **Function Return Types**: Function return types are used to specify the type of value that a function returns. In this code, the `distance` function returns an `f64`, which is the distance between the two points.

6. **Main Function**: The `main` function is the entry point for the program. In this code, the `main` function creates two `Point` structs, calls the `distance` function to calculate the distance between them, and prints the result to the console.

This code is more complex than the previous examples because it demonstrates several new concepts in Rust, such as structs, attributes, functions, function parameters, function return types, and the `main` function.
