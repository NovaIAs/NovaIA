// A Rust program that generates a random maze using the Eller's algorithm.

use rand::Rng;
use std::collections::HashSet;

// The Eller's algorithm generates a maze by dividing a grid into cells and then randomly
// merging adjacent cells until only one cell remains. The algorithm works by maintaining a
// set of disjoint sets of cells. Each set represents a connected component of the maze.
// When two adjacent cells are merged, their corresponding sets are also merged.

// The following code defines a struct called `Cell` that represents a single cell in the maze.
// Each cell has a unique ID and a set of walls that separate it from its adjacent cells.
struct Cell {
    id: usize,
    walls: HashSet<Direction>,
}

// The `Direction` enum represents the four possible directions in which a cell can have a wall.
enum Direction {
    Up,
    Down,
    Left,

// disjoint sets. The disjoint sets are represented using the `UnionFind` struct from the
// `uf` crate.

// `union` and `find`. The `union` operation merges two sets into a single set, and the `find`
// operation returns the representative of the set that contains a given element.

This code is a Rust implementation of the Eller's algorithm for generating mazes. The algorithm works by dividing a grid into cells and then randomly merging adjacent cells until only one cell remains. The code uses a union-find data structure to keep track of which cells are connected.

The `generate` function takes the dimensions of the maze as arguments and returns a `Maze` struct. The `Maze` struct contains a vector of cells and a vector of disjoint sets. The disjoint sets are represented using the `UnionFind` struct from the `uf` crate.

The `print` function prints a maze to the console. The function takes a `Maze` struct as an argument and prints a representation of the maze to the console.

The main function generates a maze and prints it to the console.
