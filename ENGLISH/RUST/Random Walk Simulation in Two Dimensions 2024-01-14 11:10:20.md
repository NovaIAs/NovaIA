This code simulates a simple random walk in two dimensions. It starts at the origin and then takes a series of random steps in any direction. The length of the random walk is specified by the user.

The code first defines the struct that will represent a point in two dimensions. The struct has two fields, `x` and `y`, which represent the x- and y-coordinates of the point.

The code then defines the function `generate_random_point`, which generates a random point in a given range. The function takes two arguments, `min` and `max`, which specify the minimum and maximum values for the x- and y-coordinates of the point.

The code then defines the function `random_walk`, which performs a random walk of a given length. The function takes one argument, `length`, which specifies the number of steps to take in the random walk.

The function `random_walk` first initializes the list of points that will be returned by the function. It then sets the current point to the origin.

The function then enters a loop that performs the random walk. In each iteration of the loop, the function generates a random direction, moves the current point in that direction, and adds the current point to the list of points.

After the loop has finished, the function returns the list of points.

The code then defines the main function. The main function first gets the length of the random walk from the user. It then calls the `random_walk` function to perform the random walk. Finally, it prints the list of points to the console.
