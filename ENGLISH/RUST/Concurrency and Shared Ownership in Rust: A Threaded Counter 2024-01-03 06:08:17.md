Certainly! Here's a complex and differentiated code written in Rust:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};

fn main() {
    // Create a shared mutable counter
    let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));

    // Create a vector to store the thread handles
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        // Clone the Arc to share ownership across threads
        let counter = Arc::clone(&counter);

        // Spawn a new thread
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            // Acquire the lock on the counter
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();

            // Increment the counter by 1
            *num += 1;
        });

        // Store the thread handle in the vector
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    // Wait for all threads to finish
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    // Get the final value of the counter
    let final_count = *counter.lock().unwrap();

    println!("Final count: {}", final_count);
}
```

Explanation:
This code demonstrates the usage of threads, shared ownership, and locks in Rust. It starts by importing the necessary modules from the standard library. Inside the `main` function, a shared mutable counter is created using `Arc` (atomic reference counting) and `Mutex` to ensure safe concurrent access.

Next, a vector is created to store the thread handles. A loop spawns 10 threads, each of which clones the shared counter using `Arc::clone`. The `move` keyword is used to transfer ownership of the counter to the thread closure.

Inside each thread closure, the lock on the counter is acquired using `counter.lock().unwrap()`. This ensures that only one thread can access the counter at a time. The counter is then incremented by 1.

The thread handles are stored in the `handles` vector. After the loop, another loop waits for each thread to finish by calling `join` on each handle. This ensures that the main thread waits for all the spawned threads to complete.

Finally, the final value of the counter is obtained by acquiring the lock and printing it to the console.

This code demonstrates a common pattern in Rust for safely sharing mutable data across multiple threads using locks. Each thread increments the counter, and the final count is printed at the end.
