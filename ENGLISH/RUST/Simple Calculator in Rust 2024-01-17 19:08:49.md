```rust
// This is a Rust program that implements a simple calculator.

// First, we define the operations that our calculator can perform.
enum Operation {
    Add,
    Subtract,
    Multiply,
    Divide,
}

// Next, we define the struct that will represent our calculator.
struct Calculator {
    // The current value of the calculator.
    value: f64,
    // The operation that the calculator will perform next.
    operation: Operation,
}

// Now, we implement the methods for our calculator.

// The `new` method creates a new calculator with a value of 0 and an operation of Add.
impl Calculator {
    fn new() -> Calculator {
        Calculator { value: 0.0, operation: Operation::Add }
    }

    // The `calculate` method performs the current operation on the calculator's value.
    fn calculate(&mut self, operand: f64) -> f64 {
        match self.operation {
            Operation::Add => self.value += operand,
            Operation::Subtract => self.value -= operand,
            Operation::Multiply => self.value *= operand,
            Operation::Divide => self.value /= operand,
        };
        self.value
    }

    // The `set_operation` method sets the calculator's operation.
    fn set_operation(&mut self, operation: Operation) {
        self.operation = operation;
    }
}

// Finally, we write the main function for our program.

fn main() {
    // We create a new calculator.
    let mut calculator = Calculator::new();

    // We calculate the result of 1 + 2 * 3.
    let result = calculator.calculate(1.0).calculate(2.0).calculate(3.0);

    // We print the result.
    println!("The result is {}", result);
}
```

**Explanation:**

This Rust program implements a simple calculator. The program first defines the operations that the calculator can perform (Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide). Then, it defines the struct that represents the calculator, which includes the current value of the calculator and the operation that the calculator will perform next.

Next, the program implements the methods for the calculator struct. The `new` method creates a new calculator with a value of 0 and an operation of Add. The `calculate` method performs the current operation on the calculator's value. The `set_operation` method sets the calculator's operation.

Finally, the program writes the main function, which creates a new calculator, calculates the result of 1 + 2 * 3, and prints the result.
