Explanation:

1. **Class Definition**: We define a class named Person that represents a person.

2. **Instance Variables**: Inside the Person class, we declare two instance variables: name and age. These variables will be used to store the name and age of each person instance.

3. **Constructor**: The initialize method is the constructor for the Person class. It takes two parameters: aName and anAge, and initializes the instance variables name and age with these values.

4. **Instance Methods**: We define several instance methods within the Person class:

   - getName: Returns the name of the person.
   - getAge: Returns the age of the person.
   - incrementAge: Increments the age of the person by one.
   - sayHello: Displays a greeting message with the person's name and age.

5. **Creating an Instance**: We create an instance of the Person class named aPerson and initialize it with the name 'John Doe' and age 30 using the initialize method.

6. **Accessing Instance Variables**: We can access the instance variables of aPerson using the getName and getAge methods.

7. **Calling Instance Methods**: We can call the instance methods of aPerson to perform actions. For example, we increment the age of aPerson and then call the sayHello method to display a greeting message.
