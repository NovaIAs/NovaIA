**Explanation:**

This code reads a text file, splits each line into words, and counts the frequency of each word. It uses a hash map to store the word frequencies. The hash map is a data structure that maps keys to values. In this case, the keys are the words and the values are the frequencies.

The code first opens the input file and creates a buffered reader for the file. The buffered reader is used to read the file line by line.

Next, the code creates a hash map to store the word frequencies. The hash map is initialized with an empty capacity.

The code then reads each line of the file and splits the line into words. It uses the `split_whitespace()` method to split the line into words. The `split_whitespace()` method splits the line on whitespace characters, which include spaces, tabs, and newlines.

After the line has been split into words, the code iterates over the words and updates the word frequencies. It uses the `get()` method to get the current frequency of the word. If the word is not in the hash map, the `get()` method returns `None`. In this case, the code uses the `unwrap_or()` method to return a default value of 0.

The code then increments the frequency of the word and inserts the word and frequency into the hash map.

After all the lines in the file have been processed, the code prints the word frequencies. It uses the `iter()` method to iterate over the hash map. The `iter()` method returns an iterator that can be used to iterate over the key-value pairs in the hash map.

The code uses the `println!()` macro to print the word and frequency. The `println!()` macro prints a formatted string to the standard output. The `{}` placeholders are used to specify the values that should be printed. The `word` and `frequency` variables are passed to the `println!()` macro as arguments.
