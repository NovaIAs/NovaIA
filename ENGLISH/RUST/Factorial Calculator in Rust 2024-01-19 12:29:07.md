```rust
// This is a Rust program that calculates the factorial of a number.

// The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number.
// For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

// We start by defining a function called `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and returns its factorial.
fn factorial(n: u64) -> u64 {
    // If the number is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1.
    if n == 0 || n == 1 {
        return 1;
    }

    // Otherwise, the factorial is the product of the number and the factorial of the number minus 1.
    else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}

// Now we can use the `factorial` function to calculate the factorial of a number.
let number = 5;
let factorial_of_number = factorial(number);

// We can print the result to the console.
println!("The factorial of {} is {}", number, factorial_of_number);
```

This code is a more complex and differentiated example of a Rust program. It includes a function that takes an argument and returns a value, and it uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a number. The code is also more verbose and includes more comments, making it easier to understand.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The first line of the code is a comment that explains what the program does.
* The second line of the code defines a function called `factorial` that takes a `u64` (unsigned 64-bit integer) as an argument and returns a `u64`.
* The third line of the code is a conditional statement that checks if the number is 0 or 1.
* If the number is 0 or 1, the fourth line of the code returns 1.
* If the number is not 0 or 1, the fifth line of the code calculates the factorial of the number by multiplying the number by the factorial of the number minus 1.
* The sixth line of the code defines a variable called `number` and sets it to the value 5.
* The seventh line of the code calls the `factorial` function with the `number` variable as an argument and stores the result in the `factorial_of_number` variable.
* The eighth line of the code prints the `number` variable and the `factorial_of_number` variable to the console.

This code is a more complex and differentiated example of a Rust program, but it is still relatively easy to understand. The code is well-commented and uses clear and concise variable names. The code also uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a number, which is a more advanced programming concept.
