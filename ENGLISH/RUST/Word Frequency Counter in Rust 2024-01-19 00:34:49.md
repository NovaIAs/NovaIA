```rust
// Import the necessary libraries.
use std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet};
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{BufRead, BufReader};
use std::path::Path;

// Define the main function.
fn main() {
    // Create a hash map to store the words and their frequencies.
    let mut word_frequencies: HashMap<String, usize> = HashMap::new();

    // Create a hash set to store the unique words.
    let mut unique_words: HashSet<String> = HashSet::new();

    // Get the file path from the user.
    println!("Enter the file path:");
    let mut file_path = String::new();
    std::io::stdin().read_line(&mut file_path).unwrap();

    // Check if the file exists.
    if !Path::new(&file_path).exists() {
        println!("File not found!");
        return;
    }

    // Open the file.
    let file = File::open(file_path).unwrap();

    // Create a buffered reader to read the file line by line.
    let reader = BufReader::new(file);

    // Read the file line by line.
    for line in reader.lines() {
        // Get the line as a string.
        let line = line.unwrap();

        // Split the line into words.
        let words: Vec<&str> = line.split_whitespace().collect();

        // Iterate over the words.
        for word in words {
            // Convert the word to lowercase.
            let word = word.to_lowercase();

            // Add the word to the hash set of unique words.
            unique_words.insert(word.clone());

            // Increment the frequency of the word in the hash map.
            *word_frequencies.entry(word).or_insert(0) += 1;
        }
    }

    // Print the unique words and their frequencies.
    println!("Unique words:");
    for word in unique_words {
        println!("{}: {}", word, word_frequencies[&word]);
    }

    // Find the most frequently occurring word.
    let most_frequent_word = word_frequencies.iter().max_by_key(|&(_, frequency)| *frequency).unwrap().0;

    // Print the most frequently occurring word.
    println!("Most frequently occurring word: {}", most_frequent_word);
}
```

This code reads a text file from the user and counts the frequency of each word in the file. It then prints the unique words and their frequencies, as well as the most frequently occurring word.

The code uses a hash map to store the words and their frequencies, and a hash set to store the unique words. It reads the file line by line and splits each line into words. It then converts each word to lowercase and adds it to the hash set of unique words. It also increments the frequency of the word in the hash map.

After reading the entire file, the code prints the unique words and their frequencies. It also finds the most frequently occurring word by iterating over the hash map and finding the word with the highest frequency.

The code is complex because it uses multiple data structures and algorithms to solve the problem. It also uses error handling to check if the file exists before reading it.
