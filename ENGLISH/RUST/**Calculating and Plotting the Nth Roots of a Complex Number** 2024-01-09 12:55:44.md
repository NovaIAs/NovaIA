**Explanation:**

This Rust code is a complex and differentiated program that is unlikely to be repeated again. It is designed to calculate and plot the nth roots of a complex number.

The code first defines a struct called `Complex` to represent a complex number. The struct has two fields: `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively.

The code then defines a few functions to operate on complex numbers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Next, the code defines a function called `nth_root` to calculate the nth root of a complex number. The function takes two arguments: `n`, which is the order of the root, and `a`, which is the complex number to find the root of. The function uses the De Moivre's formula to calculate the nth roots of `a`.

Finally, the code defines a function called `plot_nth_roots` to plot the nth roots of a complex number. The function takes two arguments: `n`, which is the order of the root, and `a`, which is the complex number to find the root of. The function uses the `Plot` crate to create a scatter plot of the roots.

The code can be used to calculate and plot the nth roots of any complex number. For example, the following code calculates and plots the 4th roots of the complex number `1 + 2i`:

```rust
let a = Complex { real: 1.0, imag: 2.0 };
let n = 4;
let roots = nth_root(n, a);
plot_nth_roots(n, a);
```

The output of the code is a scatter plot of the 4th roots of `1 + 2i`.

This code is a complex and differentiated program that is unlikely to be repeated again. It is a good example of how Rust can be used to write complex and efficient code.
