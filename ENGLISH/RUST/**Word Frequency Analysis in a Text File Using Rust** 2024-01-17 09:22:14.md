Explanation:

1. **Crate-Level Scope:** This is where we define global variables and functions that are accessible to all the modules in the program.

2. **Importing Libraries:** We import the necessary libraries using `use std::{...};`. In this case, we are using the `std` library, which provides standard Rust functionality.

3. **Error Handling Macro:** We define a macro named `error!` that takes any number of arguments and returns an `Err` result with the formatted string constructed from the arguments. This macro is used for error handling throughout the program.

4. **Main Function:** This is the entry point of the program. It returns a `Result` type, which can either be `Ok` if the program executed successfully or `Err` if an error occurred.

5. **Opening the File:** We open the file named "input.txt" in read-only mode using `File::open`. If the file cannot be opened, we return an error.

6. **Creating a BufReader:** We create a `BufReader` using `BufReader::new(file)`. This allows us to read the file line by line efficiently.

7. **Reading the File Line by Line:** We use a loop to read each line of the file using `buf_reader.lines()`. Each line is wrapped in a `Result`, which we unwrap to get the actual line. We then push the line into a vector called `lines`.

8. **Splitting the Lines into Words:** We iterate over the lines in the `lines` vector and split each line into words using `line.split_whitespace()`. We then push the words into a vector called `words`.

9. **Sorting the Words:** We sort the `words` vector in alphabetical order using `words.sort()`.

10. **Creating a Vector of Unique Words:** We iterate over the words in the `words` vector and check if each word is already in the `unique_words` vector. If it is not, we add it to the `unique_words` vector.

11. **Printing the Number of Unique Words:** We print the number of unique words in the file using `println!("Number of unique words: {}", unique_words.len());`.

12. **Printing the Unique Words:** We print each unique word in the `unique_words` vector using `println!("{}", word);`.
