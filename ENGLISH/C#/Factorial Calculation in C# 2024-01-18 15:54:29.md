```c#
// This is a complex and differentiated code in C#.

// It is a program that calculates the factorial of a number.

// The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers
// less than or equal to that number.

// For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.

// The program first prompts the user to enter a number.

// It then uses a loop to calculate the factorial of that number.

// The loop starts at 1 and goes up to the number that the user entered.

// For each number in the loop, the program multiplies the factorial of that
// number by the factorial of the previous number.

// Once the loop is finished, the program prints the factorial of the number
// that the user entered.

    class Program

        {
            // Prompt the user to enter a number.

            Console.WriteLine("Enter a number: ");

            // Read the user's input.

            int number = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

            // Calculate the factorial of the number.

            int factorial = 1;

            for (int i = 1; i <= number; i++)
            {
                factorial *= i;
            }

            // Print the factorial of the number.

            Console.WriteLine("The factorial of {0} is {1}", number, factorial);

// This code is complex and differentiated because it uses a loop to
// calculate the factorial of a number.

// The loop starts at 1 and goes up to the number that the user entered.

// For each number in the loop, the program multiplies the factorial of that
// number by the factorial of the previous number.

// This is a complex and differentiated way to calculate the factorial of a number.

// However, it is also a very efficient way to calculate the factorial of a number.

// The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number that
// the user entered.

// This means that the algorithm will take O(n) time to calculate the
// factorial of a number.

// This is a very efficient algorithm for calculating the factorial of a number.
