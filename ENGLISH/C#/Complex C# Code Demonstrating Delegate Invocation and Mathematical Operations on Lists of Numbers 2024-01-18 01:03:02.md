Here is a complex C# code that is unlikely to be repeated:

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace ComplexCode
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Define a custom delegate type
            delegate int Operation(int a, int b);

            // Create a list of operations
            List<Operation> operations = new List<Operation>
            {
                (a, b) => a + b,
                (a, b) => a - b,
                (a, b) => a * b,
                (a, b) => a / b,
                (a, b) => a % b
            };

            // Create a list of numbers
            List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

            // Perform each operation on each pair of numbers
            foreach (var operation in operations)
            {
                foreach (var number1 in numbers)
                {
                    foreach (var number2 in numbers)
                    {
                        // Skip invalid operations (e.g. division by zero)
                        if (operation == ((a, b) => a / b) && number2 == 0)
                        {
                            continue;
                        }

                        // Perform the operation and print the result
                        int result = operation(number1, number2);
                        Console.WriteLine($"{number1} {operation.Method.Name} {number2} = {result}");
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This code defines a custom delegate type `Operation` that represents a function that takes two integers as input and returns an integer as output. It then creates a list of operations that includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. The code also creates a list of numbers and performs each operation on each pair of numbers in the list. The results are then printed to the console.

Here are some explanations for the more complex parts of the code:

* The `delegate` keyword is used to define a custom delegate type. This allows you to create a type that represents a function with a specific signature. In this case, the `Operation` delegate type represents a function that takes two integers as input and returns an integer as output.
* The `operations` list contains a collection of `Operation` delegates. Each delegate represents a different mathematical operation.
* The `numbers` list contains a collection of integers.
* The `foreach` loops are used to iterate over the `operations` and `numbers` lists.
* The `if` statement is used to skip invalid operations, such as division by zero.
* The `operation(number1, number2)` expression invokes the delegate `operation` with the arguments `number1` and `number2`. This performs the mathematical operation represented by the delegate.
* The `Console.WriteLine()` statement is used to print the result of the operation to the console.

This code is complex and unlikely to be repeated because it uses a custom delegate type, a list of operations, and a list of numbers to perform a variety of mathematical operations. The use of `foreach` loops and the `if` statement also adds to the complexity of the code.
