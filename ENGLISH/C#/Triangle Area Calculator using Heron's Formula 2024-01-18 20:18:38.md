```c#
// This program calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula.

// Define the necessary variables.
double side1, side2, side3, semiperimeter, area;

// Get the lengths of the sides of the triangle from the user.
Console.WriteLine("Enter the length of the first side of the triangle (in centimeters): ");
side1 = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
Console.WriteLine("Enter the length of the second side of the triangle (in centimeters): ");
side2 = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
Console.WriteLine("Enter the length of the third side of the triangle (in centimeters): ");
side3 = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

// Calculate the semiperimeter of the triangle.
semiperimeter = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2;

// Calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula.
area = Math.Sqrt(semiperimeter * (semiperimeter - side1) * (semiperimeter - side2) * (semiperimeter - side3));

// Display the area of the triangle.
Console.WriteLine("The area of the triangle is: {0} square centimeters", area);
```

**Explanation:**

This program calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides of length `a`, `b`, and `c` is given by the formula:

```
area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
```

where `s` is the semiperimeter of the triangle, which is given by the formula:

```
s = (a + b + c) / 2
```

The program first gets the lengths of the sides of the triangle from the user. Then, it calculates the semiperimeter of the triangle using the formula given above. Next, it calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula. Finally, it displays the area of the triangle to the user.

This code is complex because it involves several mathematical calculations. However, it is also well-organized and easy to understand. The comments in the code help to explain what each part of the code is doing. Additionally, the code is modular, meaning that it is divided into small, self-contained functions. This makes it easier to maintain and debug.
