// This is a C# program that implements a simple text-based game.

// First, we define the game world as a two-dimensional array of characters.
char[,] world = {
    { 'W', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'W' },
    { 'W', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'W' },
    { 'W', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'W' },
    { 'W', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'W' },
    { 'W', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'W' }
};

// We also define the player's position in the world.
int playerX = 1;
int playerY = 1;

// The main game loop runs until the player reaches the exit.
while (world[playerX, playerY] != 'E')
{
    // Display the game world to the player.
    for (int i = 0; i < world.GetLength(0); i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < world.GetLength(1); j++)
        {
            Console.Write(world[i, j]);
        }
        Console.WriteLine();
    }

    // Get the player's input.
    Console.Write("Enter a direction (N, S, E, or W): ");
    string direction = Console.ReadLine();

    // Move the player in the specified direction.
    switch (direction)
    {
        case "N":
            if (playerY > 0)
            {

// The player has reached the exit. Display a victory message.
Console.WriteLine("Congratulations! You have reached the exit.");
```

This code implements a simple text-based game where the player can move around a world and reach the exit. The game world is represented as a two-dimensional array of characters, where each character represents a different type of tile. The player's position is also represented as a two-dimensional array of integers.

The main game loop runs until the player reaches the exit. In each iteration of the loop, the game world is displayed to the player, the player's input is obtained, and the player is moved in the specified direction.

The player can move in four directions: north, south, east, and west. The player's input is checked to see if it is a valid direction, and if it is, the player is moved in that direction.

The player wins the game when they reach the exit, which is represented by the character 'E'. When the player reaches the exit, a victory message is displayed.
