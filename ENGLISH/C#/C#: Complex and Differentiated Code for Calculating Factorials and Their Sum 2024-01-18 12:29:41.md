Sure, here is a complex and differentiated code in C# that is unlikely to be repeated again:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace ComplexCode
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Create a list of integers
            List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };

            // Create a function to calculate the factorial of a number
            Func<int, int> factorial = n => n == 0 ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1);

            // Create a list of factorials
            List<int> factorials = numbers.Select(n => factorial(n)).ToList();

            // Create a dictionary to store the factorials
            Dictionary<int, int> factorialDictionary = numbers.ToDictionary(n => n, n => factorial(n));

            // Print the factorials
            foreach (var factorial in factorialDictionary)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{factorial.Key}! = {factorial.Value}");
            }

            // Create a delegate to calculate the sum of two numbers
            Func<int, int, int> sum = (a, b) => a + b;

            // Create a function to calculate the sum of a list of numbers
            Func<List<int>, int> sumList = list => list.Aggregate(sum);

            // Calculate the sum of the factorials
            int sumOfFactorials = sumList(factorials);

            // Print the sum of the factorials
            Console.WriteLine($"The sum of the factorials is {sumOfFactorials}");
        }
    }
}
```

This code is complex and differentiated because it uses a variety of language features, including lambda expressions, LINQ, and generics. It also performs a complex calculation, which is the sum of the factorials of the numbers from 1 to 10.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The `Main` method creates a list of integers, a function to calculate the factorial of a number, and a list of factorials.
* The `factorial` function is a lambda expression that calculates the factorial of a number.
* The `factorials` list is created by using the `Select` method to apply the `factorial` function to each element of the `numbers` list.
* The `factorialDictionary` dictionary is created by using the `ToDictionary` method to convert the `numbers` list to a dictionary, where the keys are the numbers and the values are the factorials.
* The `foreach` loop prints the factorials to the console.
* The `sum` delegate is a lambda expression that calculates the sum of two numbers.
* The `sumList` function is a generic function that calculates the sum of a list of numbers.
* The `sumOfFactorials` variable is calculated by calling the `sumList` function with the `factorials` list as the argument.
* The `Console.WriteLine` statement prints the sum of the factorials to the console.

This code is complex and differentiated, but it is also a good example of how to use C# language features to write efficient and readable code.
