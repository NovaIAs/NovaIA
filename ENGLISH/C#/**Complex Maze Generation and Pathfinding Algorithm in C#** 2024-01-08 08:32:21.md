**Explanation:**

This code generates a random maze and then finds a path from the start to the end cell.

The `Cell` class represents a cell in the maze. It has the following properties:

* `X` and `Y`: The coordinates of the cell.
* `North`, `East`, `South`, and `West`: The walls of the cell.
* `Visited`: A flag indicating whether the cell has been visited.

The `Maze` class represents the maze. It has the following properties:

* `Cells`: The cells of the maze.
* `Start` and `End`: The start and end cells of the maze.

The `Maze` class also has the following methods:

* `GenerateMaze()`: This method generates the maze.
* `GetNeighbors()`: This method gets the neighbors of a cell.
* `Shuffle()`: This method shuffles a list of cells.
* `BreakWall()`: This method breaks the wall between two cells.
* `FindPath()`: This method finds a path from the start to the end cell.

The `Program` class is the main class. It creates a maze, finds a path from the start to the end cell, and prints the path.
