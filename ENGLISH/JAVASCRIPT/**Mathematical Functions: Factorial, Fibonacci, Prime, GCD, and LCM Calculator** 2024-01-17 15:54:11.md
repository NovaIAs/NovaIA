```javascript
// This code defines a function called 'factorial' that calculates the factorial of a given number.
// The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number.

  // Otherwise, the factorial is n multiplied by the factorial of n-1.
  else {

// This code defines a function called 'fibonacci' that calculates the nth Fibonacci number.
// The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
function fibonacci(n) {

// This code defines a function called 'isPrime' that determines whether a given number is prime.
// A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
function isPrime(n) {

// This code defines a function called 'gcd' that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
// The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.
function gcd(a, b) {

// This code defines a function called 'lcm' that calculates the least common multiple of two numbers.
// The least common multiple of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.
function lcm(a, b) {
  // Calculate the greatest common divisor of the two numbers.

This code contains four different functions that perform different mathematical calculations:

* The **factorial** function calculates the factorial of a given number.
* The **fibonacci** function calculates the nth Fibonacci number.
* The **isPrime** function determines whether a given number is prime.
* The **gcd** function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
* The **lcm** function calculates the least common multiple of two numbers.

These functions are all implemented using recursive algorithms, which means that they call themselves to solve smaller instances of the problem. This can be a very efficient way to solve certain types of problems, but it can also be difficult to understand.

The code also uses a number of mathematical concepts, such as the factorial, the Fibonacci sequence, prime numbers, the greatest common divisor, and the least common multiple. These concepts can be challenging to understand, but they are also very important in many areas of mathematics and computer science.

Overall, this code is a good example of how JavaScript can be used to solve complex mathematical problems. It is also a good example of how recursive algorithms can be used to efficiently solve certain types of problems.
