```javascript
// Define an object with various properties and methods.
const complexObject = {
  // Property: An array of numbers.
  numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],

  // Property: A nested object with key-value pairs.
  personalInfo: {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30,
    city: "New York"
  },

  // Property: A function that returns the sum of two numbers.
  addNumbers: function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  },

  // Property: A method that changes the value of the 'city' property in the 'personalInfo' object.
  changeCity: function(newCity) {
    this.personalInfo.city = newCity;
  },

  // Property: A getter function that returns the current value of the 'city' property in the 'personalInfo' object.
  getCity: function() {
    return this.personalInfo.city;
  }
};

// Accessing and using the properties and methods of the object:

// Log the array of numbers.
console.log(complexObject.numbers);

// Log the value of the 'name' property in the 'personalInfo' object.
console.log(complexObject.personalInfo.name);

// Invoke the 'addNumbers' method and log the result.
console.log(complexObject.addNumbers(2, 5));

// Invoke the 'changeCity' method to change the value of the 'city' property.
complexObject.changeCity("Los Angeles");

// Invoke the 'getCity' method to retrieve the updated value of the 'city' property.
console.log(complexObject.getCity());

// The output will be:
// [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
// John Doe
// 7
// Los Angeles
```

Explanation:

* The code defines a complex JavaScript object named `complexObject` with various properties and methods.
* The object has an array of numbers (`numbers`), a nested object (`personalInfo`) with key-value pairs, a function (`addNumbers`) that takes two numbers and returns their sum, a method (`changeCity`) to change the value of the `city` property in the `personalInfo` object, and a getter method (`getCity`) to retrieve the current value of the `city` property.
* The code then accesses and uses these properties and methods in various ways, such as logging their values to the console, invoking the methods, and changing the value of the `city` property.
* This code demonstrates the use of complex JavaScript objects with multiple properties, methods, and nested objects, providing a more advanced and realistic example of JavaScript object manipulation.
