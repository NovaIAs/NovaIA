// This is a complex and differentiated JavaScript code that is unlikely to be repeated again.
// It is designed to demonstrate the power and flexibility of the JavaScript language.

// The code starts by defining a function called "generateRandomNumber" that generates a random number between 1 and 100.
function generateRandomNumber() {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
}

// Next, the code defines an array called "numbers" that contains 100 random numbers generated by the "generateRandomNumber" function.
const numbers = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  numbers.push(generateRandomNumber());
}

// The code then defines a function called "findUniqueNumbers" that takes an array of numbers as input and returns an array of unique numbers from the input array.
function findUniqueNumbers(array) {
  const uniqueNumbers = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (!uniqueNumbers.includes(array[i])) {
      uniqueNumbers.push(array[i]);
    }
  }
  return uniqueNumbers;
}

// The code then defines a function called "calculateAverage" that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the average of the numbers in the input array.
function calculateAverage(array) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    sum += array[i];
  }
  return sum / array.length;
}

// The code then defines a function called "findMedian" that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the median of the numbers in the input array.
function findMedian(array) {
  array.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  const middleIndex = Math.floor(array.length / 2);
  if (array.length % 2 === 0) {
    return (array[middleIndex] + array[middleIndex - 1]) / 2;
  } else {
    return array[middleIndex];
  }
}

// The code then defines a function called "findMode" that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the mode of the numbers in the input array.
function findMode(array) {
  const counts = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    const number = array[i];
    counts[number] = (counts[number] || 0) + 1;

    if (counts[number] > maxCount) {
      maxCount = counts[number];
      mode = number;
    }
  }
  return mode;
}

// The code then defines a function called "displayResults" that takes an array of numbers, an array of unique numbers, the average of the numbers, the median of the numbers, and the mode of the numbers as input and displays the results to the user.
function displayResults(numbers, uniqueNumbers, average, median, mode) {
  console.log("Original numbers:");
  console.log(numbers);
  console.log("Unique numbers:");
  console.log(uniqueNumbers);
  console.log("Average:");
  console.log(average);
  console.log("Median:");
  console.log(median);
  console.log("Mode:");
  console.log(mode);
}

// Finally, the code calls the "displayResults" function with the "numbers" array, the "uniqueNumbers" array, the "average" value, the "median" value, and the "mode" value as arguments.
displayResults(numbers, findUniqueNumbers(numbers), calculateAverage(numbers), findMedian(numbers), findMode(numbers));

This code is a complex and differentiated JavaScript code that is unlikely to be repeated again. It is designed to demonstrate the power and flexibility of the JavaScript language. The code includes a variety of functions that perform different tasks, such as generating random numbers, finding unique numbers, calculating the average of an array of numbers, finding the median of an array of numbers, and finding the mode of an array of numbers. The code also includes a function that displays the results of these calculations to the user.
