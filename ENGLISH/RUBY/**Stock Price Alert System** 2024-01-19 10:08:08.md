Explanation:

1. **Modules and Classes**: The code includes the `Singleton` and `Observer` modules and defines two classes: `StockQuoteObserver` and `StockAlert`.

2. **Singleton Pattern**: The `StockQuoteObserver` class utilizes the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of this class exists throughout the program. This ensures a central observer that all alerts can subscribe to.

3. **Observer Pattern**: The `StockQuoteObserver` class includes the `Observable` module, allowing it to be observed by other objects. It also includes methods for adding and notifying observers.

4. **Stock Alert Class**: The `StockAlert` class represents individual stock alerts. It takes a stock symbol and a minimum price as arguments and subscribes to the `StockQuoteObserver`.

5. **Callback Method**: The `StockAlert` class defines an `update` method that serves as the callback function. When a new stock quote is available, this method is called for all registered alerts.

6. **Callback Logic**: Inside the `update` method, the alert checks if the current stock symbol and price meet the alert criteria (price below the minimum price). If so, it prints an alert message.

7. **Stock Quote Fetcher Class**: The `StockQuoteFetcher` class simulates fetching stock quotes from an external API. In a real-world scenario, this class would connect to an API and retrieve actual stock data.

8. **Fetching and Notifying**: An instance of the `StockQuoteFetcher` class is created, and the `fetch_quotes` method is called to retrieve a list of stock quotes. These quotes are then passed to the `notify_alerts` method of the `StockQuoteObserver` instance to trigger the alerts.

This code showcases the Singleton and Observer design patterns in Ruby, allowing multiple alerts to be subscribed to a single observer and notified about stock price changes that meet their criteria. It also demonstrates the use of a fetcher class to simulate retrieving stock quotes from an external data source.
