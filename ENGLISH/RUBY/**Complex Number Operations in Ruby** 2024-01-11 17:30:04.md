This code defines a `Complex` class in Ruby, which represents complex numbers. The class has methods for performing various operations on complex numbers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, absolute value, conjugate, exponential, natural logarithm, square root, nth root, powers, trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions, inverse trigonometric functions, and inverse hyperbolic functions.

The program demonstrates the use of the `Complex` class by creating two complex numbers, `c1` and `c2`, and then performing various operations on them. The results are then printed to the console.

Here is an explanation of the code:

* The `Complex` class is defined with two instance variables, `@real` and
