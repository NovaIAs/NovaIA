This Ruby program is a simple command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program first defines a method called `get_input` that gets the user's input from the command line. The `calculate` method is then defined to perform the calculation based on the operator and operands provided by the user. Finally, the `puts` statement is used to print the result of the calculation to the console.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

* The `get_input` method uses the `print` and `gets` methods to get the user's input from the command line. The `chomp` method is then used to remove the newline character from the input string.
* The `calculate` method takes two arguments: the operator and the operands. The `case` statement is used to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the value of the `operator` argument. The `sum`, `-`, `*`, and `/` methods are used to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively.
* The `puts` statement is used to print the result of the calculation to the console.

This Ruby program is a simple example of how to write a command-line calculator in Ruby. It can be used to perform basic arithmetic operations on two operands.
