This code generates a random maze using the recursive backtracking algorithm. The maze is represented as a two-dimensional array of cells, where each cell can be either a wall or a path. The algorithm starts at a random cell and recursively carves out paths to neighboring cells, until the entire maze is generated.

The code first defines the Cell class to represent each cell in the maze. The Cell class has three instance variables: x and y, which represent the cell's coordinates in the maze, and walls, which is an array of four booleans representing the four walls of the cell (north, east, south, and west).

The code then defines the Maze class to represent the entire maze. The Maze class has one instance variable, cells, which is a two-dimensional array of Cell objects.

The generate_maze method is used to generate the maze using the recursive backtracking algorithm. The method takes two arguments: x and y, which represent the coordinates of the current cell.

The method first marks the current cell as visited. It then chooses a random direction to move in. If there are unvisited cells in the current direction, the method removes the wall in the current direction and moves to the next cell in that direction. The method then recursively generates the maze from the current cell in all other directions.

Finally, the print_maze method is used to print the maze to the console. The method iterates over each cell in the maze and prints the top, right, and bottom walls of the cell.

To use the code, you can create a new maze object and then call the print_maze method to print the maze to the console. For example:

```ruby
maze = Maze.new(20, 10)
maze.print_maze
```

This will generate a random maze with a width of 20 and a height of 10 and print the maze to the console.
