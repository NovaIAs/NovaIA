```ruby
# This Ruby code defines a class called "ComplexAlgorithm" that encapsulates a complex algorithm for some specific purpose.

class ComplexAlgorithm
  # Initialize the algorithm with the given input data.
  def initialize(input_data)
    # Store the input data for later use.
    @input_data = input_data
  end

  # Run the algorithm and return the result.
  def run
    # Perform a series of complex calculations and operations on the input data.
    # These calculations can be highly customized and specific to the problem being solved.

    # For example, here we are performing some mathematical operations:
    result = @input_data.map do |x|
      (x**2 - 1) / (x + 2)
    end

    # Return the result of the algorithm.
    result
  end
end

# Example usage:
input_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create an instance of the algorithm with the given input data.
algorithm = ComplexAlgorithm.new(input_data)

# Run the algorithm and get the result.
result = algorithm.run

# Print the result.
puts result
```

Explanation:

1. `class ComplexAlgorithm`: This line defines a new class named `ComplexAlgorithm`. A class defines a blueprint for creating objects with specific attributes and behaviors.

2. `initialize` Method: The `initialize` method is a special method that is called when a new object of the class is created. It takes the input data as an argument and stores it in the instance variable `@input_data`. Instance variables are used to store data that is specific to each object.

3. `run` Method: The `run` method is the main method of the class. It performs the actual algorithm. In this example, we are performing some mathematical operations on the input data using the `map` method. The `map` method applies a block of code to each element of an array and returns a new array with the results.

4. `result = algorithm.run`: This line calls the `run` method on the `algorithm` object and stores the result in the variable `result`.

5. `puts result`: This line prints the value of the `result` variable to the console.
