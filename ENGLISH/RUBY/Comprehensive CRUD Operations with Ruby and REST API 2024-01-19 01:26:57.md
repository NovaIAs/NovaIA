Explanation:

This code demonstrates how to perform various CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using the REST API of a hypothetical example website. It includes requests to create a new user, update the user's name, create a new post, update the post's content, create a new comment, and update the comment's content. The code uses the `rest-client` gem to make HTTP requests and the `json` gem to parse JSON responses.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Require the Necessary Gems**: The script requires the `json` and `rest-client` gems, which are used for parsing JSON responses and making HTTP requests, respectively.

2. **Define the Base URL and API Key**: The base URL of the API and the API key are defined.

3. **Define Request Headers**: The headers for the API requests are defined, including the `Content-Type`, `Accept`, and `Authorization` headers.

4. **Create a New User**: A new user is created by making a POST request to the `/users` endpoint with the appropriate body containing the user's name, email, and password. The response is parsed into a Ruby object.

5. **Update User's Name**: The user's name is updated by making a PUT request to the `/users/:id` endpoint with an updated name in the request body. The response is parsed into a Ruby object.

6. **Create a New Post**: A new post is created by making a POST request to the `/posts` endpoint with the appropriate body containing the post's title and content. The response is parsed into a Ruby object.

7. **Update Post's Content**: The post's content is updated by making a PUT request to the `/posts/:id` endpoint with an updated content in the request body. The response is parsed into a Ruby object.

8. **Create a New Comment**: A new comment is created by making a POST request to the `/comments` endpoint with the appropriate body containing the comment's content. The response is parsed into a Ruby object.

9. **Update Comment's Content**: The comment's content is updated by making a PUT request to the `/comments/:id` endpoint with an updated content in the request body. The response is parsed into a Ruby object.

10. **Print the Results**: The newly created and updated objects (user, post, and comment) are printed to the console for demonstration purposes.

This code demonstrates a complex and diverse sequence of API requests and responses, showcasing different HTTP methods (POST, PUT) and resource endpoints (/users, /posts, /comments). It also involves creating, updating, and retrieving data from the API.
