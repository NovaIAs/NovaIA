This code defines a class called "Complex" that represents complex numbers. The class has methods for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing complex numbers, as well as methods for getting the absolute value, complex conjugate, exponential form, and string representation of a complex number.

The code also creates two complex numbers, c1 and c2, and performs various operations on them. The results of these operations are printed to the console.
