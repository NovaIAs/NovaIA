```ruby
# This code simulates the behavior of a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.

# Define a method called 'calculate' that takes three arguments: the first number, the second number, and the operation to be performed.
def calculate(num1, num2, operation)
  # Use a case statement to determine which operation to perform based on the value of the 'operation' argument.
  case operation
  when '+'
    # If the operation is addition, return the sum of the two numbers.
    return num1 + num2
  when '-'
    # If the operation is subtraction, return the difference of the two numbers.
    return num1 - num2
  when '*'
    # If the operation is multiplication, return the product of the two numbers.
    return num1 * num2
  when '/'
    # If the operation is division, return the quotient of the two numbers, handling division by zero gracefully.
    return num1 / num2 unless num2 == 0
    return "Division by zero is undefined."
  else
    # If the operation is not one of the supported operations, return an error message.
    return "Invalid operation specified."
  end
end

# Prompt the user to enter the first number.
puts "Enter the first number:"

# Read the user's input and convert it to a floating-point number.
num1 = gets.chomp.to_f

# Prompt the user to enter the second number.
puts "Enter the second number:"

# Read the user's input and convert it to a floating-point number.
num2 = gets.chomp.to_f

# Prompt the user to enter the operation to be performed.
puts "Enter the operation to be performed (+, -, *, /):"

# Read the user's input.
operation = gets.chomp

# Call the 'calculate' method to perform the specified operation on the two numbers.
result = calculate(num1, num2, operation)

# Display the result of the calculation to the user.
puts "The result is: #{result}"
```

This code is designed to be complex and differentiated by incorporating various features:

1. **Multiple Operations**: The code supports four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **Error Handling**: The code handles division by zero gracefully, returning an error message instead of raising an exception.

3. **User Interaction**: The code prompts the user to enter the numbers and the operation to be performed, making it interactive.

4. **Modular Design**: The code is organized into a function called 'calculate', which performs the actual calculation, and the main program logic is kept separate.

5. **Robustness**: The code checks for invalid operations and handles them by returning an error message.

6. **Clarity and Documentation**: The code includes comments to explain its purpose and the functionality of each section.

Overall, this code demonstrates a more comprehensive and complex implementation of a basic calculator in Ruby.
