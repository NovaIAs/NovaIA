Explanation:

1. We define a class called `ComplexNumber` to represent complex numbers. It has instance variables `@real` and `@imaginary` to store the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

2. We define methods for addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), finding the absolute value (`abs`), finding the complex conjugate (`conjugate`), and converting the complex number to a string (`to_s`).

3. We create two complex numbers, `c1` and `c2`, using the `ComplexNumber` class.

4. We perform various operations on the complex numbers using the defined methods and print the results.

This code demonstrates various operations on complex numbers and showcases the use of object-oriented programming in Ruby.
