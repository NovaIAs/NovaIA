**Explanation:**

This Ruby program demonstrates the use of various programming concepts, including:

* **Factorial:** The `factorial` method calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using recursion.
* **Fibonacci Sequence:** The `fibonacci` method generates a Fibonacci sequence of a given length using a loop.
* **Palindrome:** The `palindrome?` method checks if a given string is a palindrome using regular expressions and string manipulation.
* **Longest Common Subsequence:** The `longest_common_subsequence` method finds the longest common subsequence of two strings using dynamic programming.
* **Shortest Path in a Weighted Graph:** The `shortest_path` method finds the shortest path in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.
* **Weighted Graph:** The `Graph` class represents a weighted graph using an adjacency list.
* **Edge:** The `Edge` class represents an edge in a weighted graph.

The program also includes a demonstration of how to use the `shortest_path` method to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
