### Classes and Objects in Ruby ###

# Defining a Class
class Person
    # Initialize method to set instance variables
    def initialize(name, age)
        @name = name
        @age = age
    end

    # Getter method for the name instance variable
    def name
        @name
    end

    # Setter method for the name instance variable
    def name=(new_name)
        @name = new_name
    end

    # Getter method for the age instance variable
    def age
        @age
    end

    # Setter method for the age instance variable
    def age=(new_age)
        @age = new_age
    end

    # Instance method to greet someone
    def greet(other_person)
        puts "Hello #{other_person.name}, my name is #{self.name}."
    end

    # Class method to create a new Person object
    def self.create(name, age)
        Person.new(name, age)
    end
end

# Creating an instance of the Person class
person1 = Person.create("John", 25)
person2 = Person.create("Mary", 30)

# Accessing instance variables using getter methods
puts person1.name  # Output: John
puts person1.age   # Output: 25

# Modifying instance variables using setter methods
person1.name = "John Doe"
person1.age = 30

# Calling instance method to greet someone
person1.greet(person2)  # Output: Hello Mary, my name is John Doe.

### Modules in Ruby ###

# Defining a module
module Talkative
    # Define a method that can be mixed into a class
    def talk
        puts "I can talk!"
    end
end

# Include the Talkative module in the Person class
class Person
    include Talkative
end

# Creating an instance of the Person class
person3 = Person.create("Bob", 40)

# Calling the talk method defined in the Talkative module
person3.talk  # Output: I can talk!

### Iterators and Blocks in Ruby ###

# Define an array of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Using the each iterator to iterate over the array
numbers.each do |number|
    puts number
end

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5

# Using the map iterator to transform each element of the array
squared_numbers = numbers.map do |number|
    number ** 2
end

# Output:
# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Using the select iterator to filter the array
even_numbers = numbers.select do |number|
    number % 2 == 0
end

# Output:
# [2, 4]

### Regular Expressions in Ruby ###

# Define a regular expression pattern to match digits
digit_pattern = /\d+/

# Use the scan method to find all occurrences of the pattern in a string
string = "The year is 2023 and the population is 8 billion."
matches = digit_pattern.scan(string)

# Output:
# ["2023", "8"]

# Use the =~ operator to find the starting position of the first match
match_position = digit_pattern =~ string

# Output:
# 11

### Metaprogramming in Ruby ###

# Define a method that dynamically creates a method
def create_method(name)
    define_method(name) do
        puts "Hello from the #{name} method!"
    end
end

# Dynamically create a new method named 'greet_ruby'
create_method :greet_ruby

# Call the dynamically created method
greet_ruby  # Output: Hello from the greet_ruby method!

### Exceptions and Error Handling in Ruby ###

# Define a method that may raise an exception
def divide_by_zero
    10 / 0
end

# Use a begin-rescue block to handle the exception
begin
    divide_by_zero
rescue ZeroDivisionError => e
    puts "Error: #{e.message}"
end

# Output:
# Error: divided by 0

### Concurrency in Ruby ###

# Define a thread that prints a message
thread = Thread.new do
    puts "Hello from a separate thread!"
end

# Join the thread to wait for it to finish
thread.join

# Output:
# Hello from a separate thread!

### Networking in Ruby ###

# Require the socket library
require 'socket'

# Create a TCP server socket
server = TCPServer.new 2000

# Accept a client connection
client = server.accept

# Read data from the client
data = client.recv(1024)

# Output:
# Hello from the client!

### File Handling in Ruby ###

# Open a file for reading
file = File.open("data.txt", "r")

# Read the contents of the file
contents = file.read

# Output:
# This is some data stored in a file.

# Close the file
file.close

### Conclusion ###
