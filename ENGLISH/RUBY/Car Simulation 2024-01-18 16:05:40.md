Explanation:

The provided Ruby code defines a class called "Car" with some instance variables and methods to represent and manipulate the state of a car object. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `class Car`: This line defines a new class named "Car." Classes in Ruby serve as blueprints for creating objects with specific attributes and behaviors.

2. `# Initialize`: This is a constructor method, also known as the `initialize` method, which is called when a new `Car` object is created. It takes three arguments (`make`, `model`, and `year`) and assigns them to instance variables `@make`, `@model`, and `@year`, respectively. It also initializes `@speed` to 0.

3. Getter and Setter Methods:
   - Getter methods (`make`, `model`, `year`, and `speed`) retrieve the values of their respective instance variables.
   - Setter methods (`speed=`) allow setting the value of the `@speed` instance variable.

4. `accelerate` and `brake` Methods:
   - `accelerate`: This method increases the current speed of the car by the specified amount (argument `amount`).
   - `brake`: This method decreases the current speed of the car by the specified amount (argument `amount`).

5. `display_info` Method: This method displays the current state of the car, including its make, model, year, and speed.

6. Creating a `Car` Object:
   - `car = Car.new("Toyota", "Camry", 2018)`: This line creates a new instance of the `Car` class with the specified make, model, and year, and assigns it to the `car` variable.

7. Method Calls:
   - `car.display_info`: This line calls the `display_info` method on the `car` object to display its initial state.
   - `car.accelerate(20)`: This line calls the `accelerate` method to increase the car's speed by 20 mph.
   - `car.display_info`: This line calls the `display_info` method again to display the car's state after accelerating.
   - `car.brake(10)`: This line calls the `brake` method to decrease the car's speed by 10 mph.
   - `car.display_info`: This line calls the `display_info` method one last time to display the car's state after braking.

This code essentially simulates a car object, allowing you to accelerate and brake and display its current state, including its speed. The getter and setter methods provide controlled access to the car's attributes.
