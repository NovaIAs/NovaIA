The code creates a complex and differentiated code that is unlikely to be repeated. To achieve this, it first defines a method to generate a random string of a given length. It does this by creating an array of all the characters that can be used in the random string, such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits. It then loops through the desired length of the random string and gets a random character from the array, adding it to the random string.

Next, the code defines a method to generate a complex and differentiated code. It does this by looping through the desired length of the complex code. For each iteration, it generates a random string of a random length and adds it to the complex code. It also has a chance of adding a random operator, such as +, -, *, /, or %, to the complex code.

Finally, the code generates a complex code of length 100 and prints it to the console. The complex code is likely to be unique and difficult to guess, making it suitable for use in applications where security is a concern.
