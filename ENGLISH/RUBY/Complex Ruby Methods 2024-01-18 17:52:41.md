This code contains five different methods, each of which performs a complex operation.

The first method, `calculate_complex_value`, takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`.

The second method, `find_largest_element_in_array`, takes an array as a parameter and returns the largest element in the array.

The third method, `generate_random_matrix`, takes two parameters, `rows` and `columns`, and returns a random matrix with the specified number of rows and columns.

The fourth method, `invert_binary_tree`, takes a binary tree as a parameter and inverts the tree, swapping the left and right subtrees.

The fifth method, `find_all_paths_in_graph`, takes a graph and a starting vertex as parameters and returns a list of all paths in the graph that start from the specified vertex.
