Explanation:

This code defines a method called `find_nth_occurrence` that takes a string, a substring, and an integer representing the desired occurrence as arguments. The method uses a loop to iterate through the string and count the number of occurrences of the substring. When the counter variable reaches the desired occurrence, the method returns the index of the current character. If the desired occurrence is not found, the method returns -1.

The code then prompts the user to enter the input string, the substring to search for, and the desired occurrence. It calls the `find_nth_occurrence` method to find the index of the nth occurrence of the substring in the string. If the index is valid, it prints the index of the occurrence. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating that the substring was not found.

This code is complex and differentiated because it combines several programming concepts, including method definition, string manipulation, looping, and conditional statements. It is also flexible and can be used to find the nth occurrence of any substring in any string.
