This code defines a class called "Book" that represents a book with attributes such as title, author, pages, genre, and price. It also includes methods to get and modify these attributes, as well as methods to calculate the discount price, check stock availability, and add or remove books from stock.

The code then creates a new "Book" object with the title "The Hunger Games", author "Suzanne Collins", 384 pages, genre "Science Fiction", and a price of 12.99. It then demonstrates how to use the various methods of the "Book" class to access and manipulate the book's attributes, calculate the discount price, check stock availability, and adjust the stock quantity.
