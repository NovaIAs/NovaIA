Explanation:

1. Define a method `factorial` to calculate the factorial of a number. Factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.
2. Create a Hash `factorials` to store the calculated factorial values.
3. Calculate and store the factorials of numbers from 0 to 10 in the Hash.
4. Define an array `numbers` containing some numbers.
5. Calculate the sum of the factorials of the numbers in the array and display the result.
6. Define a method `fibonacci` to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1.
7. Calculate and display the Fibonacci sequence up to 10 terms.
8. Define an array `words` containing some words.
9. Sort the words in alphabetical order using the `sort` method.
10. Display the sorted words.
11. Find and display the longest word in the array using the `max_by` method.
12. Group the words by their first letter using the `group_by` method.
13. Display the grouped words.
14. Create a Hash `word_counts` to store the occurrences of each word in the array.
15. Count the occurrences of each word in the array and store them in the Hash.
16. Display the word counts.

This code combines various Ruby features and demonstrates operations such as factorial calculation, Fibonacci sequence generation, sorting, grouping, counting, and displaying data. It showcases the versatility and expressiveness of the Ruby language.
