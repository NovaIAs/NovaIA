**Explanation:**

1. We define a `Car` class with attributes `make`, `model`, `year`, and `color`.

2. We initialize the `Car` class with these attributes in the `initialize` method.

3. We define a `to_s` method in the `Car` class to return a string representation of the car object.

4. We create an array of `Car` objects with different makes, models, years, and colors.

5. We iterate over the array of car objects and print their string representations.

6. We define a `sort_by_year` method to sort the array of car objects by year.

7. We sort the array of car objects by year using the `sort_by_year` method and print their string representations.

8. We define a `group_by_make` method to group the array of car objects by make.

9. We group the array of car objects by make using the `group_by_make` method and print the make and the car objects in each group.

10. We define a `find_most_expensive_car` method to find the most expensive car object in the array.

11. We find the most expensive car object in the array using the `find_most_expensive_car` method and print its string representation.

This code demonstrates various complex features of Ruby, including classes, objects, arrays, methods, iteration, sorting, grouping, and finding maximum values. It illustrates how to organize and manipulate data efficiently in Ruby.
