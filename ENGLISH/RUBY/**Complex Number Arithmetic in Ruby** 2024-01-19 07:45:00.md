Explanation:

1. We define a class called `ComplexNumber` to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts.

2. We define methods for addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`) of complex numbers.

3. We also define methods for calculating the absolute value (`abs`) and the complex conjugate (`conj`) of a complex number.

4. We create two complex numbers, `c1` and `c2`, and perform various operations on them, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

5. We use the `to_s` method to represent the complex numbers as strings.

This code demonstrates advanced operations on complex numbers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, absolute value, and complex conjugate. It uses object-oriented programming principles and provides a flexible way to represent and manipulate complex numbers in Ruby.
