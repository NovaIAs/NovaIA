Explanation:

1. Create an empty hash `data` to store the data.
2. Define a method `parse_line` that takes a line of data as an argument and returns a hash containing the key-value pairs in the line.
3. Open the input file `input.txt` in read mode.
4. Loop through each line in the file using the `each_line` method.
5. For each line, parse it using the `parse_line` method and store the resulting hash in the `data` hash.
6. After processing all the lines in the file, print the `data` hash.

This code is complex because it involves multiple steps and uses custom methods to process the data. It is also differentiated because it is unlikely to be repeated in other contexts, as it is specific to the task of parsing a particular input file format.
