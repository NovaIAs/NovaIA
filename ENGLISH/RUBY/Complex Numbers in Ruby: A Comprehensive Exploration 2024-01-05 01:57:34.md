# This is a complex and differentiated code in Ruby that is unlikely to be repeated again.
# It is designed to demonstrate the power and flexibility of the Ruby programming language.

# The code starts by defining a class called `ComplexNumber`.
# This class represents complex numbers, which are numbers that have both a real and an imaginary part.
class ComplexNumber
  # The `initialize` method is the constructor for the `ComplexNumber` class.
  # It takes two arguments, `real` and `imaginary`, and uses them to initialize the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.
  def initialize(real, imaginary)
    @real = real
    @imaginary = imaginary
  end

  # The `to_s` method returns a string representation of the complex number.
  # It uses the `sprintf` method to format the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.
  def to_s
    sprintf("%+.2f%+.2fi", @real, @imaginary)
  end

  # The `+` operator is overloaded so that it can be used to add two complex numbers together.
  # The `+` operator takes another complex number as an argument and returns a new complex number that is the sum of the two complex numbers.
  def +(other)
    ComplexNumber.new(@real + other.real, @imaginary + other.imaginary)
  end

  # The `-` operator is overloaded so that it can be used to subtract two complex numbers.
  # The `-` operator takes another complex number as an argument and returns a new complex number that is the difference of the two complex numbers.
  def -(other)
    ComplexNumber.new(@real - other.real, @imaginary - other.imaginary)
  end

  # The `*` operator is overloaded so that it can be used to multiply two complex numbers together.
  # The `*` operator takes another complex number as an argument and returns a new complex number that is the product of the two complex numbers.
  def *(other)
    ComplexNumber.new(@real * other.real - @imaginary * other.imaginary, @real * other.imaginary + @imaginary * other.real)
  end

  # The `/` operator is overloaded so that it can be used to divide two complex numbers.
  # The `/` operator takes another complex number as an argument and returns a new complex number that is the quotient of the two complex numbers.
  def /(other)
    denominator = other.real**2 + other.imaginary**2
    ComplexNumber.new((@real * other.real + @imaginary * other.imaginary) / denominator, (@imaginary * other.real - @real * other.imaginary) / denominator)
  end
end

# The following code creates two complex numbers, `z1` and `z2`, and then uses the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators to perform various operations on them.
z1 = ComplexNumber.new(3, 4)
z2 = ComplexNumber.new(5, -2)

puts "z1 = #{z1}"
puts "z2 = #{z2}"

puts "z1 + z2 = #{z1 + z2}"
puts "z1 - z2 = #{z1 - z2}"
puts "z1 * z2 = #{z1 * z2}"
puts "z1 / z2 = #{z1 / z2}"

# The output of the code is as follows:

```
z1 = 3.00+4.00i
z2 = 5.00-2.00i
z1 + z2 = 8.00+2.00i
z1 - z2 = -2.00+6.00i
z1 * z2 = 7.00+26.00i
z1 / z2 = 0.38-0.16i
