puts "The final state of the economy is:"

```

This code simulates a simple economy with 100 agents. The agents can produce goods, consume goods, and trade goods and labor with each other. The market sets the prices of goods and labor based on supply and demand.

The simulation runs for 100 iterations. At each iteration, the agents update the prices in the market, trade goods and labor, produce goods, and consume goods.

The final state of the economy is printed out to the console. The output shows the total money, goods, and labor in the economy, as well as the prices of goods and labor.
