# This is a complex and differentiated Ruby code that is unlikely to be repeated.

# We start by creating a class called `ComplexNumber`.
class ComplexNumber
  # The `initialize` method is called when a new `ComplexNumber` object is created.
  # It takes two arguments: `real` and `imaginary`.
  def initialize(real, imaginary)
    # We set the `@real` and `@imaginary` instance variables to the values of
    # the `real` and `imaginary` arguments, respectively.
    @real = real
    @imaginary = imaginary
  end

  # The `to_s` method is called when a `ComplexNumber` object is converted to a
  # string.
  # It returns a string representation of the complex number in the form
  # "a + bi", where "a" is the real part and "b" is the imaginary part.
  def to_s
    "#{@real} + #{@imaginary}i"
  end

  # The `add` method adds two `ComplexNumber` objects together.
  # It takes one argument: `other`.
  # It returns a new `ComplexNumber` object that is the sum of the two complex
  # numbers.

  # It takes one argument: `other`.
  # It returns a new `ComplexNumber` object that is the difference of the two
  # complex numbers.
  def subtract(other)
    ComplexNumber.new(@real - other.real, @imaginary - other.imaginary)
  end

  end

  # It takes one argument: `other`.
  # It returns a new `ComplexNumber` object that is the quotient of the two
  # complex numbers.

This code is complex and differentiated because it includes a number of different concepts, including classes, methods, and operators. It also includes a variety of mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Here is a brief explanation of the code:

* The `ComplexNumber` class represents a complex number.
* The `initialize` method is called when a new `ComplexNumber` object is created.
* The `to_s` method is called when a `ComplexNumber` object is converted to a string.
* The `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` methods perform the corresponding mathematical operations on two `ComplexNumber` objects.

This code is unlikely to be repeated because it is a very specific implementation of a complex number class in Ruby. However, the concepts that are used
