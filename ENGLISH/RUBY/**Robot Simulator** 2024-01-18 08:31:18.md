Explanation:

1. **Class Definition**: We define a class called `Robot` that represents a robot with attributes like a name, color, and weight.

2. **Constructor (`initialize` method)**: The `initialize` method is called when a new `Robot` object is created. It takes three arguments: `name`, `color`, and `weight`, and assigns them to instance variables (`@name`, `@color`, and `@weight`).

3. **`move` Method**:
   - The `move` method takes two arguments: `direction` and `distance`.
   - It uses a `case` statement to handle different directions.
   - Depending on the direction, it prints a message indicating the robot's movement.

4. **`speak` Method**:
   - The `speak` method takes a single argument: `message`.
   - It simply prints the given message, simulating the robot's speech.

5. **`display_info` Method**:
   - The `display_info` method doesn't take any arguments.
   - It uses string interpolation to display the robot's information, including name, color, and weight.

6. **Creating Robot Objects**:
   - We create two `Robot` objects: `robot1` and `robot2`.
   - We initialize each object with different values for name, color, and weight.

7. **Calling Robot Methods**:
   - We call the `move`, `speak`, and `display_info` methods on the `robot1` and `robot2` objects to simulate their actions and display their information.

This code provides a more complex and varied demonstration of object-oriented programming in Ruby, including the use of different methods, class instances, and message passing.
