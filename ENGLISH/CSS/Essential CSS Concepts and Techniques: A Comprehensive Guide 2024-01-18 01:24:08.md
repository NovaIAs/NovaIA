```css
/* Comments */
/* CSS comments are used to provide annotations or instructions to developers or other readers of the code. They are ignored by the browser and do not affect the styling of elements. */

/* Rulesets */
/* CSS rulesets consist of a selector, followed by a curly brace block containing one or more declarations. Declarations consist of a property name, followed by a colon, followed by one or more values. */

/* Selectors */
/* Selectors identify the HTML elements to which the styles will be applied. They include: */
* { /* The universal selector selects all elements on the page */ }
h1 { /* The type selector selects all elements of the specified type (e.g., headings) */ }
#header { /* The ID selector selects the element with the specified ID */ }
.container { /* The class selector selects all elements with the specified class */ }
p:hover { /* The pseudo-class selector selects elements in a specific state (e.g., when hovered over) */ }

/* Properties */
/* Properties define the style attributes of elements. Common properties include: */
color: #ff0000; /* The color property sets the color of text */
font-size: 16px; /* The font-size property sets the size of text */
background-color: #ffffff; /* The background-color property sets the background color of an element */

/* Values */
/* Values specify the values of properties. Values can be: */
#ff0000; /* Hexadecimal color values */
16px; /* Pixel values */
bold; /* Keywords */
url("image.png"); /* URL values */

/* Specificity */
/* Specificity determines which rule will be applied to an element when multiple rules target it. Elements with more specific rules take precedence. Specificity is calculated as follows: */
ID selectors: 100
Class selectors, pseudo-classes, attributes: 10
Type selectors, pseudo-elements: 1
Universal selector: 0

/* Inheritance */
/* Styles can be inherited from parent elements to child elements. Child elements inherit all properties that are not explicitly defined in their own styles. */

/* Media Queries */
/* Media queries allow you to apply different styles to elements based on the device or viewport. They are defined using the @media rule. */

@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}

/* Animations */
/* CSS animations allow you to create animated transitions between different styles. They are defined using the @keyframes rule. */

@keyframes fadeOut {
  from {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}

.fadeOut {
  animation-name: fadeOut;
  animation-duration: 1s;
}

/* Grid Layout */
/* CSS grid layout allows you to create complex layouts using a grid of cells. It is defined using the display: grid; property. */

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 25% 25% 50%;
}

.grid-item {
  background-color: #ff0000;
  padding: 10px;
}

/* Flexbox Layout */
/* CSS flexbox layout allows you to create flexible layouts that can adapt to different screen sizes. It is defined using the display: flex; property. */

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.flex-item {
  background-color: #ff0000;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 10px;
}

/* Variables */
/* CSS variables allow you to store values that can be reused throughout your stylesheet. They are defined using the var() function. */

:root {
  --primary-color: #ff0000;
}

body {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
}

/* Preprocessors */
/* CSS preprocessors like Sass and LESS allow you to write more concise and maintainable CSS code. They are compiled into CSS before being sent to the browser. */

// Sass example
$primary-color: #ff0000;

body {
  background-color: $primary-color;
}

/* This is just a brief overview of some of the most common and useful features of CSS. There are many more features that you can explore to create complex and engaging designs. */
