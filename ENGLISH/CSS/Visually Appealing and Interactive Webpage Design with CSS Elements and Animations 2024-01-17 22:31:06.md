  This CSS code creates a complex and visually appealing design with various elements and animations.
  Let's break down the code section by section:

1. Background:
   - body {
       background: linear-gradient(#000000, #434343);
     }
   - This sets a linear gradient background for the entire page, transitioning from black (#000000) to a darker shade of gray (#434343).

2. Container:
   - .container {
       width: 100%;
       max-width: 1200px;
       margin: 0 auto;
     }
   - This defines a container div with a maximum width of 1200px and centers it horizontally on the page.

3. Header:
   - header {
       background: #fff;
       padding: 20px;
     }
   - This creates a white header section with some padding.

4. Navigation:
   - nav {
       display: flex;
       justify-content: space-between;
       align-items: center;
     }
   - This sets the navigation bar to display its elements horizontally, spaced evenly between them, and vertically centered.

   - nav ul {
       display: flex;
     }
   - This styles the unordered list inside the navigation to display its list items horizontally.

   - nav li {
       margin-right: 20px;
     }
   - This adds a right margin to each list item in the navigation.

   - nav li a {
       text-decoration: none;
       color: #000;
       font-size: 1.2rem;
     }
   - This removes the default text decoration from the navigation links, sets their color to black, and specifies a font size of 1.2rem.

   - nav li a:hover {
       color: #434343;
     }
   - This changes the color of the navigation links to a darker shade of gray when hovered.

5. Hero Section:
   - .hero {
       background-image: url("hero-image.jpg");
       background-position: center;
       background-size: cover;
       height: 600px;
     }
   - This sets a hero section with a background image, positioning it at the center and covering the entire section.

6. Hero Text:
   - .hero-text {
       position: absolute;
       top: 50%;
       left: 50%;
       transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
       color: #fff;
       font-size: 3rem;
       text-align: center;
     }
   - This positions the hero text absolutely, centers it both horizontally and vertically within the hero section, sets its color to white, specifies a font size of 3rem, and centers the text.

7. Animation:
   - .hero-text span {
       display: inline-block;
       animation: typing 3s steps(10, end) infinite;
     }
   - This sets each span element inside the hero text to be displayed inline and applies a typing animation that simulates typing out the text character by character.

   - @keyframes typing {
       from {
           width: 0;
         }
       to {
           width: 100%;
         }
     }
   - This defines the typing animation, where the width of the span element animates from 0 to 100%, essentially making the text appear as if it's being typed out.

8. Services Section:
   - .services {
       background: #f5f5f5;
       padding: 40px;
     }
   - This creates a services section with a light gray background and some padding.

9. Service Cards:
   - .service-card {
       width: 25%;
       margin: 0 10px;
       padding: 20px;
       background: #fff;
       box-shadow: 0 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
     }
   - This defines the service cards, setting their width, margins, padding, background color, and box shadow.

   - .service-card:hover {
       box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
     }
   - This applies a larger box shadow to the service cards when hovered.

10. Service Card Content:
    - .service-card-icon {
        font-size: 3rem;
        color: #434343;
      }
    - This styles the service card icons with a font size of 3rem and a dark gray color.

    - .service-card-title {
        font-size: 1.5rem;
        font-weight: bold;
      }
    - This sets the title of each service card with a font size of 1.5rem and bold weight.

    - .service-card-description {
        font-size: 1.2rem;
      }
    - This styles the description text of each service card with a font size of 1.2rem.

11. Footer:
    - footer {
        background: #000;
        color: #fff;
        padding: 20px;
      }
    - This creates a black footer section with white text and some padding.

12. Media Queries:
    - @media (max-width: 992px) {
        .container {
            max-width: 90%;
          }
        .service-card {
            width: 50%;
          }
      }
    - These media queries adjust the layout for smaller screens, reducing the maximum width of the container and making the service cards wider to fit better.
