Explanation:

The code starts by importing the necessary libraries.

The `ComplexCode` class contains a single `main` method, which is the entry point of the program.

The `main` method creates a list of integers, filters the list to only include even numbers, maps the list of even numbers to their squares, and prints the list of squared even numbers.

The `main` method also creates a list of strings, filters the list to only include strings that start with the letter "a", maps the list of strings starting with "a" to their uppercase equivalents, and prints the list of uppercase strings starting with "a".

The `main` method also creates a list of objects, filters the list to only include objects that are of type String, and prints the list of strings from objects.

The `main` method also creates a map of names to ages, filters the map to only include entries where the age is greater than 30, and prints the map of names to ages greater than 30.

This code is complex and differentiated because it uses a variety of Java language features, including lambda expressions, streams, and method references. It also demonstrates how to work with different data types, including lists, maps, and objects.
