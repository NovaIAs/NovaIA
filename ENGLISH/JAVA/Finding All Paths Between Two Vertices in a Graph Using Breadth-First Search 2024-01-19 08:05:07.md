This code implements a complex graph algorithm to find all paths between two vertices in a graph. It uses a breadth-first search approach to explore all possible paths from the source vertex to the destination vertex. The code also handles errors using a custom exception class.

The main method of the program creates a graph with 6 vertices and 6 edges. It then calls the findPaths method to find all paths between vertices 0 and 4. The solution is then printed to the console.

Here is a detailed explanation of the code:

* The Graph class represents a graph as a map of vertices to their neighbors.
* The Path class represents a path in a graph as a list of vertices.
* The Solution class represents a solution to a graph problem as a list of paths.
* The findPaths method uses a breadth-first search to find all paths between two vertices in a graph.
* The main method creates a graph, calls the findPaths method to find all paths between two vertices, and then prints the solution to the console.

This code is a complex example of an algorithm in Java. It demonstrates how to use a breadth-first search to solve a graph problem. The code also uses error handling to ensure that it can handle errors gracefully.
