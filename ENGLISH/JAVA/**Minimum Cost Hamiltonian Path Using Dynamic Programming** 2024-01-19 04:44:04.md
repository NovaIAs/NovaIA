**Explanation:**

This Java code solves the Minimum Cost Hamiltonian Path problem in a graph. A Hamiltonian path is a path in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. The minimum cost Hamiltonian path is the Hamiltonian path with the minimum total edge weight.

The code uses dynamic programming to efficiently solve the problem. It maintains a memoization table to store the minimum cost paths for different states. A state in this problem is represented by the current vertex and the set of vertices that have been visited so far.

The function `findMinCostHamiltonianPath` is the core of the algorithm. It takes a graph, a state, and a memoization table as input and returns the minimum cost Hamiltonian path from the current state. It first checks if the state has already been computed. If it has, it returns the stored minimum cost. Otherwise, it iterates over all adjacent vertices, creates a new state by adding the adjacent vertex to the visited vertices, and recursively finds the minimum cost path from the adjacent vertex. It then adds the minimum cost to the cost of the edge between the current vertex and the last visited vertex and stores the minimum cost in the memoization table. Finally, it returns the minimum cost.

The `main` method creates a graph and initializes the memoization table. It then calls the `findMinCostHamiltonianPath` function to find the minimum cost Hamiltonian path in the graph. Finally, it prints the minimum cost.

This code demonstrates advanced concepts such as dynamic programming, memoization, and graph traversal. It is a good example of how to solve a complex problem efficiently using a dynamic programming approach.
