This code reads a text file and calculates the frequency of each word in the file. The code uses a Scanner object to read the input lines, a HashMap to store the words and their frequencies, and a TreeMap to store the words and their frequencies in sorted order. The code then prints the words and their frequencies to the console.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

* The main() method is the entry point of the program. It creates a Scanner object, an ArrayList to store the input lines, a HashMap to store the words and their frequencies, and a TreeMap to store the words and their frequencies in sorted order. It then reads the input lines until the user enters an empty line, and adds the words to the HashMap. It then prints the words and their frequencies to the console.
* The Scanner object is used to read the input lines from the console.
* The ArrayList is used to store the input lines.
* The HashMap is used to store the words and their frequencies.
* The TreeMap is used to store the words and their frequencies in sorted order.
* The for loop is used to iterate over the input lines and add the words to the HashMap.
* The split() method is used to split the line into words using a regular expression.
* The for loop is used to iterate over the words and add them to the HashMap.
* The if statement is used to check if the word is already in the HashMap.
* If the word is not in the HashMap, it is added with a frequency of 1.
* If the word is already in the HashMap, its frequency is incremented.
* The TreeMap is used to store the words and their frequencies in sorted order.
* The for loop is used to iterate over the TreeMap and print the words and their frequencies to the console.
