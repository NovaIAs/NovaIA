Explanation:

This Java program is a bit complex and does a few different things.

The factorial() method calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer. The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

The gcd() method calculates the greatest common divisor of two non-negative integers. The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. For example, the greatest common divisor of 12 and 18 is 6.

The isPrime() method checks if a given integer is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, 5 is a prime number because it has no positive divisors other than 1 and 5.

The findPrimes() method finds all the prime numbers up to a given non-negative integer. It uses the isPrime() method to check if each integer is prime and adds it to a list if it is.

The mergeSort() method sorts a given list of integers in ascending order using the merge sort algorithm. Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by recursively dividing the list into smaller and smaller sublists until each sublist contains only one element. The sublists are then merged together in sorted order.

The merge() method is a helper method for the merge sort algorithm. It merges two sorted lists into a single sorted list.

The printList() method prints a given list of integers to the console.

The main() method is the entry point of the program. It takes a non-negative integer as an argument and prints the list of prime numbers up to that integer.

To use this program, you can compile it using the javac command and then run it using the java command. For example, if you save the program in a file called ComplexJavaCode.java, you can compile it using the following command:

```
javac ComplexJavaCode.java
```

And then run it using the following command:

```
java ComplexJavaCode 100
```

This will print the list of prime numbers up to 100 to the console.
