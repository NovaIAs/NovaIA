Explanation:

This Java program calculates and prints the Fibonacci sequence for a given number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. For example, the first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence are:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

The program starts by prompting the user to enter a positive integer, which represents the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence to be calculated. If the user enters an invalid input (a non-positive integer), the program prints an error message and exits.

Next, the program creates an array called `fibonacciSequence` to store the Fibonacci sequence. The array is initialized with the first two values of the Fibonacci sequence, which are 0 and 1.

The program then uses a loop to calculate the remaining values of the Fibonacci sequence. For each value, the program adds the two previous values in the sequence. For example, to calculate the third value, the program adds the first value (0) and the second value (1), which gives 1.

Once all the values of the Fibonacci sequence have been calculated, the program prints the sequence to the console.

Here is a sample output of the program:

```
Enter a positive integer: 10
The Fibonacci sequence for 10 terms is:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```
