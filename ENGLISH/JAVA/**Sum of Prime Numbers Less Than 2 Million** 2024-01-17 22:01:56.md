This code calculates the sum of all prime numbers less than 2 million. It uses the sieve of Eratosthenes to generate a list of prime numbers up to MAX_SIZE, and then sums up all the primes that are less than 2 million.

The code is complex because it uses a number of techniques that are not commonly used in programming, such as the sieve of Eratosthenes and the use of a list to store the prime numbers. Additionally, the code is long and contains a number of nested loops, which can make it difficult to follow.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The `sieve` array is used to mark the non-prime numbers up to MAX_SIZE. A value of 1 indicates that the number is not prime, while a value of 0 indicates that the number is prime.
* The `primes` list is used to store the prime numbers that are found by the sieve of Eratosthenes.
* The `for` loop in the main method generates the sieve of Eratosthenes. It starts at 2 and goes up to MAX_SIZE. For each number `i`, it checks if `i` is prime. If `i` is prime, it adds `i` to the `primes` list and marks all multiples of `i` as non-prime by setting the corresponding value in the `sieve` array to 1.
* The `for` loop that starts after the sieve of Eratosthenes is generated is used to calculate the sum of all prime numbers less than 2 million. It iterates over the `primes` list and adds each prime number to the `sum` variable. If a prime number is greater than or equal to 2 million, the loop breaks.
* The `System.out.println()` statement prints the final sum of all prime numbers less than 2 million.
