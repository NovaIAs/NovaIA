Explanation:

* The `minOperations` function takes two strings, `s1` and `s2`, as input and returns the minimum number of operations required to make the two strings equal.
* The function first checks if the two strings are of different lengths. If they are, it calls the `insertCharacters` function to insert spaces into the shorter string to make it equal to the longer string.
* Once the two strings are of the same length, the function compares them character by character. If two characters at the same index are different, the function increments the `operations` variable.
* The function returns the value of the `operations` variable at the end.
* The `insertCharacters` function takes two arguments: a string `str` and an integer `diff`. The function inserts `diff` spaces into the string `str` and returns the modified string.
* The main function creates an instance of the `Solution` class and calls the `minOperations` function with different test cases. The output is printed to the console.
