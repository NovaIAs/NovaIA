Here's a complex and differentiated Java code that exhibits a high level of abstraction and sophisticated programming techniques:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;
import java.util.stream.IntStream;
import java.util.function.Function;
import java.util.function.Supplier;
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException;

public class ComplexJavaCode {

    // A ConcurrentHashMap to store key-value pairs
    private static ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, String> cache = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    // An AtomicInteger to generate unique keys
    private static AtomicInteger keyGenerator = new AtomicInteger(0);

    // A CompletableFuture to handle asynchronous tasks
    private static CompletableFuture<String> future = new CompletableFuture<>();

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Generate 1000 keys and values concurrently
        IntStream.range(0, 1000).parallel().forEach(i -> {
            int key = keyGenerator.incrementAndGet();
            String value = "Value " + key;
            cache.put(key, value);
        });

        // Asynchronously retrieve a value from the cache
        CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> cache.get(500))
                .thenAccept(value -> System.out.println("Retrieved value: " + value));

        // Asynchronously calculate the sum of a range of numbers
        CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> IntStream.range(1, 1000).sum())
                .thenAccept(sum -> System.out.println("Sum of numbers: " + sum));

        // Asynchronously perform a long-running task with a timeout
        try {
            String result = future.supplyAsync(() -> {
                try {
                    TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(5);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                return "Long-running task completed";
            }).get(3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            System.out.println(result);
        } catch (ExecutionException | InterruptedException | TimeoutException e) {
            System.out.println("Long-running task timed out or failed");
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1. **Concurrent Data Structures**: The code utilizes a ConcurrentHashMap to store key-value pairs in a thread-safe manner. This allows for concurrent access and modification of the cache.

2. **Atomic Variable**: An AtomicInteger is used to generate unique keys for the cache entries. This ensures that each key is unique and avoids collisions.

3. **Asynchronous Programming**: CompletableFuture is employed for asynchronous programming. It enables the execution of long-running tasks in separate threads, allowing the main thread to continue its execution without being blocked.

4. **Lambda Expressions**: Lambda expressions are used extensively throughout the code for concise and functional programming. They simplify the code and improve its readability.

5. **Parallel Processing**: IntStream's parallel() method is used to generate keys and values concurrently. This takes advantage of multiple cores and speeds up the process.

6. **Chaining CompletableFuture Tasks**: CompletableFuture's thenAccept() method is used to chain tasks together. This allows for the execution of multiple tasks in sequence, where the result of one task is used as the input for the next.

7. **Timeout Handling**: When performing long-running tasks asynchronously, a timeout is specified using the get() method with a timeout parameter. This prevents the main thread from being blocked indefinitely in case the task takes longer than expected.

This code demonstrates a combination of advanced Java features, including concurrency, asynchronous programming, lambda expressions, parallel processing, and timeout handling. It showcases the versatility and power of the Java programming language for building complex and efficient applications.
