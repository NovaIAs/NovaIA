Explanation:

This complex Java code performs a wide range of operations to analyze and summarize data related to a group of students. It includes:

1. **Input and Storage:**
   - Reads the number of students from the console.
   - Reads the names and scores of each student from the console.
   - Stores the student names in a list, the scores in a list, and both in a map with names as keys and scores as values.

2. **Identifying the Highest Scoring Student:**
   - Iterates through the list of scores to find the highest score.
   - Finds the name of the student with the highest score using the map.

3. **Calculating the Average Score:**
   - Calculates the total score by summing all the scores.
   - Calculates the average score by dividing the total score by the number of students.

4. **Determining the Median Score:**
   - Sorts the list of scores in ascending order.
   - Calculates the median score based on whether the number of students is even or odd.

5. **Finding the Mode Score:**
   - Creates a map to store each unique score and its frequency.
   - Iterates through the map to find the score with the highest frequency, which is the mode score.
