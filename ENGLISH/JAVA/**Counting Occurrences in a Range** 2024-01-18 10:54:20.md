Explanation:

This code is a solution to a programming problem. It takes an array of integers as input and answers a series of queries about the array.

The code first sorts the array in ascending order. It then finds the minimum and maximum values in the array and calculates the range of values in the array.

The code then creates an array of frequencies, where each element of the array represents the frequency of a value in the range. The code also creates an array of cumulative frequencies, where each element represents the sum of the frequencies of all values up to and including that value.

The code then reads a series of queries, where each query is a value in the range. For each query, the code finds the index of the value in the array of cumulative frequencies. The difference between the index of the value and the index of the value minus one is the number of occurrences of the value in the array.

The code prints the number of occurrences of the value in the array for each query.

Overall, this code is a complex and efficient solution to a programming problem. It uses a variety of data structures and algorithms to solve the problem in a time-efficient manner.
