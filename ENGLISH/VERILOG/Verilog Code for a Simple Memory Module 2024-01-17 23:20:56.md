```verilog
module top_module(input clk, rst, in, output out);

parameter WIDTH = 32;
parameter DEPTH = 1024;

reg [WIDTH-1:0] memory [0:DEPTH-1];
reg [WIDTH-1:0] reg_out;

wire [WIDTH-1:0] addr = in;

always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (rst) begin
    reg_out <= 0;
  end else begin
    reg_out <= memory[addr];
  end
end

assign out = reg_out;

endmodule
```

This Verilog code implements a simple memory module with a given width and depth.

* The `top_module` module is the top-level module of the design.
* The `clk` and `rst` inputs are the clock and reset signals, respectively.
* The `in` input is the address of the memory location to be read.
* The `out` output is the data read from the memory location specified by the `in` input.
* The `WIDTH` parameter specifies the width of the memory data in bits.
* The `DEPTH` parameter specifies the depth of the memory in words.
* The `memory` array is a register array that stores the memory data.
* The `reg_out` register stores the data read from the memory location specified by the `in` input.
* The `addr` wire is the address of the memory location to be read.
* The `always` block is a clocked always block that implements the read operation.
* The `assign` statement assigns the data read from the memory location specified by the `in` input to the `out` output.

This code is complex because it uses a lot of different features of the Verilog language, including parameters, arrays, registers, wires, always blocks, and assign statements. It is also complex because it implements a relatively complex function, namely, a memory read operation.

This code is different from other Verilog code because it uses a lot of different features of the language and because it implements a relatively complex function. It is also different from other Verilog code because it is written in a very concise and efficient style.
