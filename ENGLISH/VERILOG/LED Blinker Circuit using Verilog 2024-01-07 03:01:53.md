This code implements a simple LED blinker circuit using Verilog. The circuit has three LEDs: red, green, and blue. The red LED blinks at a rate of 1 Hz, the green LED blinks at a rate of 2 Hz, and the blue LED is always off.

The code is divided into three main sections:

1. **Module Declaration:**

   ```verilog
   module TopLevelModule(
     input  wire        clk,
     input  wire        rst,
     output wire        led_red,
     output wire        led_green,
     output wire        led_blue
   );
   ```

   This section declares the module's name, input ports, and output ports. The module has two input ports: `clk` (clock) and `rst` (reset). It has three output ports: `led_red`, `led_green`, and `led_blue`.

2. **Internal Registers:**

   ```verilog
   reg [7:0] counter = 8'b0;
   reg       led_state = 1'b0;
   ```

   This section declares the internal registers used by the circuit. The `counter` register is used to keep track of the current time. The `led_state` register is used to store the current state of the LEDs.

3. **Clock Divider and LED State Machine:**

   ```verilog
   // Clock divider
   always @(posedge clk) begin
     if (rst) begin
       counter <= 8'b0;
     end else begin
       counter <= counter + 1'b1;
     end
   end

   // LED state machine
   always @(posedge clk) begin
     if (rst) begin
       led_state <= 1'b0;
     end else begin
       case (counter)
         8'd0:   led_state <= 1'b0;
         8'd25:  led_state <= 1'b1;
         8'd50:  led_state <= 1'b0;
         8'd75:  led_state <= 1'b1;
         8'd100: led_state <= 1'b0;
         8'd125: led_state <= 1'b1;
         8'd150: led_state <= 1'b0;
         8'd175: led_state <= 1'b1;
         8'd200: led_state <= 1'b0;
         8'd225: led_state <= 1'b1;
         8'd250: led_state <= 1'b0;
         8'd275: led_state <= 1'b1;
         8'd300: led_state <= 1'b0;
         8'd325: led_state <= 1'b1;
         8'd350: led_state <= 1'b0;
         8'd375: led_state <= 1'b1;
         default: led_state <= 1'b0;
       endcase
     end
   end
   ```

   These sections implement the clock divider and the LED state machine. The clock divider divides the input clock by 400 to create a 1 Hz clock. The LED state machine uses the 1 Hz clock to blink the LEDs.

4. **LED Outputs:**

   ```verilog
   // Assign LED outputs
   assign led_red   = led_state;
   assign led_green = ~led_state;
   assign led_blue  = 1'b0;
   ```

   This section assigns the values of the `led_state` register to the LED output ports. The red LED is connected to the `led_red` port, the green LED is connected to the `led_green` port, and the blue LED is connected to the `led_blue` port.
