**Module:** Verilog Code

```
module complex_verilog_code(input clk, input rst, input [31:0] data_in, output [31:0] data_out);

reg [31:0] register_1;
reg [31:0] register_2;
reg [31:0] register_3;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (rst) begin
        register_1 <= 32'h00000000;
        register_2 <= 32'h00000000;
        register_3 <= 32'h00000000;
    end else begin
        register_1 <= data_in + register_2;
        register_2 <= register_1 - register_3;
        register_3 <= register_2 * register_1;
    end
end

assign data_out = register_3;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- This Verilog code creates a module that carries out multiple operations on input data. It includes three 32-bit registers (register_1, register_2, and register_3).


- The module has one input port (data_in) and one output port (data_out). The input is a 32-bit data value, and the output is the result of the operations performed on the input data.


- The module contains an always block that is triggered by the positive edge of the clock (posedge clk). This block continuously updates the values stored in the registers.


- If the reset signal (rst) is asserted, all three registers are initialized to zero to ensure that they start with known values.


- When rst is inactive, the module performs the following operations:
  - It adds the data_in value to the value in register_2 and stores the result back in register_1.
  - It subtracts the value in register_3 from the value in register_1 and stores the result back in register_2.
  - It multiplies the values in register_2 and register_1 and stores the result back in register_3.


- The output of the module (data_out) is the value stored in register_3, which is the result of the multiplication operation.

This code demonstrates complex logic operations, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and shows how these operations can be performed concurrently within a single module. The use of registers allows the intermediate results to be stored, enabling continuous updates based on the input data and the computed values.
