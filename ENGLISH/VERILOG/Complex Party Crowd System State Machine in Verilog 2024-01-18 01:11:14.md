// State Machine Verilog Code for a Complex Party Crowd System

// Define the states of the party crowd system
// IDLE: The party crowd is waiting for something to happen.
// DANCING: The party crowd is dancing to the music.
// MIXING: The party crowd is mingling and talking to each other.
// DRINKING: The party crowd is drinking and having fun.
// FATIGUED: The party crowd is getting tired and needs a break.

This Verilog code implements a complex party crowd system that can transition between different states based on the input music and drinks. The system has five states: IDLE, DANCING, MIXING, DRINKING, and FATIGUED. The state transition logic is implemented using a case statement that checks the current state and the input music and drinks signals to determine the next state. The output logic assigns the state of the system to the corresponding output signals.
