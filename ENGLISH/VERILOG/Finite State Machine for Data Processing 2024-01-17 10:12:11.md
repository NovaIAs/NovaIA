This code is a Verilog module that implements a simple finite state machine (FSM) to process data. The module has three states: STATE_IDLE, STATE_PROCESS, and STATE_OUTPUT.

The module has three inputs: clk, rst, and data_in. The clk input is the clock signal, the rst input is the reset signal, and the data_in input is the data to be processed.

The module has one output: data_out. The data_out output is the processed data.

The FSM state transition logic is implemented using a case statement. The case statement is used to select the next state based on the current state and the input signals.

The FSM state transition logic is as follows:

* If the current state is STATE_IDLE and the data_in input is not equal to 0, then the next state is STATE_PROCESS.
* If the current state is STATE_PROCESS, then the next state is STATE_OUTPUT.
* If the current state is STATE_OUTPUT, then the next state is STATE_IDLE.

The FSM state transition logic is implemented using a case statement. The case statement is used to select the next state based on the current state and the input signals.

The FSM state transition logic is as follows:

* If the current state is STATE_IDLE and the data_in input is not equal to 0, then the next state is STATE_PROCESS.
* If the current state is STATE_PROCESS, then the next state is STATE_OUTPUT.
* If the current state is STATE_OUTPUT, then the next state is STATE_IDLE.
