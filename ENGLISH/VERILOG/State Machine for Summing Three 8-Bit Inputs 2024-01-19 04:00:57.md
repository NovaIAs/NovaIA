This Verilog code implements a simple state machine that takes in three 8-bit inputs and computes their sum. The state machine has five states:

1. STATE_IDLE: This is the initial state of the state machine. In this state, the state machine waits for the first input to be received.
2. STATE_LOAD_A: Once the first input is received, the state machine transitions to this state and loads the input into register A.
3. STATE_LOAD_B: After loading register A, the state machine transitions to this state and loads the second input into register B.
4. STATE_LOAD_C: After loading register B, the state machine transitions to this state and loads the third input into register C.
5. STATE_COMPUTE: After loading all three inputs, the state machine transitions to this state and computes the sum of the three inputs. The sum is then stored in the data_out register.

The state machine remains in the STATE_COMPUTE state until the data_out register is read. Once the data_out register is read, the state machine transitions back to the STATE_IDLE state and waits for the next set of inputs to be received.

The always block in the code implements the state machine's next state logic. This logic determines the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the current inputs.

The case statement in the always block implements the next state logic for the state machine. The case statement has one case for each state of the state machine. Each case statement contains the logic for determining the next state of the state machine when the state machine is in that state.

The if statement in the always block implements the reset logic for the state machine. The reset logic forces the state machine to transition to the STATE_IDLE state when the reset input is asserted.

The reg statement in the code defines the internal registers of the state machine. The reg statement declares the registers and specifies their size and type.

The assign statement in the code assigns the output of the state machine to the data_out output port. The assign statement is used to connect the internal registers of the state machine to the output port.
