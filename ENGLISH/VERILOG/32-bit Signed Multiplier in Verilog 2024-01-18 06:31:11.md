```verilog
module Multiplier(inA, inB, outProd);
  input signed [31:0] inA, inB;
  output signed [31:0] outProd;

  wire signed [63:0] product; // 64-bit product

  assign product = inA * inB; // Multiply the inputs

  // Break the product into two 32-bit parts
  wire signed [31:0] highProd = product[63:32];
  wire signed [31:0] lowProd = product[31:0];

  // Add the high and low parts to get the final product
  assign outProd = highProd + lowProd;
endmodule
```

This is a Verilog code for a multiplier. It takes two signed 32-bit inputs and produces a signed 32-bit output. The code first multiplies the two inputs to get a 64-bit product. Then, it breaks the product into two 32-bit parts. Finally, it adds the two parts to get the final product.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* **Module Declaration:** The first line of the code declares a module named `Multiplier`. A module is a basic unit of organization in Verilog and it defines a specific function or behavior.

* **Input and Output Declarations:** The next two lines declare the input and output signals of the multiplier. The inputs are `inA` and `inB`, which are both signed 32-bit integers. The output is `outProd`, which is also a signed 32-bit integer.

* **Wire Declaration:** The next line declares a wire named `product`. A wire is a temporary variable that can hold a value during the simulation or synthesis process. In this case, the wire will hold the 64-bit product of `inA` and `inB`.

* **Multiplication:** The next line performs the multiplication of `inA` and `inB` using the `*` operator. The result is assigned to the `product` wire.

* **Breaking the Product:** The next two lines break the 64-bit product into two 32-bit parts. The `highProd` wire holds the high 32 bits of the product, and the `lowProd` wire holds the low 32 bits of the product.

* **Addition:** The final line adds the `highProd` and `lowProd` wires to get the final product. The result is assigned to the `outProd` output.

This code implements a simple multiplier using Verilog. It is a basic building block for many digital circuits, such as arithmetic logic units (ALUs).
