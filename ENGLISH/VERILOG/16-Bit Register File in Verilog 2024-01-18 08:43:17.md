Explanation:

- The `RegisterFile` module is a top-level module for a 16-bit register file.


- The module has the following input ports:
  - `clock`: Clock signal
  - `reset`: Reset signal
  - `write_enable`: Write enable signal
  - `read_address_1`: Read address 1
  - `read_address_2`: Read address 2
  - `write_address`: Write address
  - `write_data`: Write data


- The module has the following output ports:
  - `read_data_1`: Read data 1
  - `read_data_2`: Read data 2


- The register file is implemented as an array of 32 16-bit registers.


- The `RegisterFile` module has a write operation that is performed on the rising edge of the clock. If the `write_enable` signal is asserted and the `reset` signal is deasserted, the data in the `write_data` port is written to the register specified by the `write_address` port.


- The `RegisterFile` module also has two read operations that can be performed concurrently. The data from the register specified by the `read_address_1` port is output on the `read_data_1` port, and the data from the register specified by the `read_address_2` port is output on the `read_data_2` port.


- The `RegisterFile` module is a commonly used component in many digital circuits, such as microprocessors and FPGAs. It provides a way to store data that can be accessed quickly and efficiently.
