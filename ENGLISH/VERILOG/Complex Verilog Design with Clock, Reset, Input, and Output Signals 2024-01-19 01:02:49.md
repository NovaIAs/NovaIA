    else begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end

Explanation:

- The `complex_design` module has two input signals: `clock` and `reset`, and two output signals: `data_in` and `data_out`.
- The `always` block is used to implement the behavior of the module. It is executed on every rising edge of the `clock` signal.
- Inside the `always` block, the counter is incremented on every clock cycle.
- The input data is stored in a register `data_reg` on the rising edge of the clock.
- Some complex operations are performed on the data to generate the output data. In this case, the output data is the bitwise XOR of the input data and the counter value.
