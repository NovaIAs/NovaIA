This Verilog code implements a simple RISC-V processor. It has a register file with 32 registers, an instruction memory with 1024 instructions, a data memory with 1024 words, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and a program counter (PC). The processor can execute the following instructions:

* **ADD:** Adds two registers and stores the result in a third register.
* **SUB:** Subtracts two registers and stores the result in a third register.
* **AND:** Performs a bitwise AND operation on two registers and stores the result in a third register.
* **OR:** Performs a bitwise OR operation on two registers and stores the result in a third register.
* **XOR:** Performs a bitwise XOR operation on two registers and stores the result in a third register.
* **SLT:** Sets a register to 1 if the first register is less than the second register, and 0 otherwise.
* **SLTU:** Sets a register to 1 if the first register is less than the second register, unsigned, and 0 otherwise.
* **BEQ:** Branches to a specified address if the first register is equal to the second register.
* **BNE:** Branches to a specified address if the first register is not equal to the second register.
* **LW:** Loads a word from memory into a register.
* **SW:** Stores a word from a register into memory.

The processor fetches instructions from the instruction memory, decodes them, and executes them. The results of the instructions are stored in the register file or the data memory.

Here is a brief explanation of the code:

* The `Top_Module` module is the top-level module of the processor. It instantiates all of the other modules and connects them together.
* The `Instruction_Decoder` module decodes the instructions fetched from the instruction memory. It generates the control signals that tell the other modules what to do.
* The `Register_File` module stores the values of the registers. It has two read ports and one write port.
* The `Arithmetic_Logic_Unit` module performs the arithmetic and logical operations on the data from the register file.
* The `Data_Memory` module stores the values of the data memory. It has one read port and one write port.
* The `Program_Counter` module keeps track of the address of the next instruction to be fetched. It has a clock input and a reset input.
* The `Mux_Data_In` and `Mux_Program_Counter` modules are multiplexers that select the data to be written to the register file and the next address to be fetched from the instruction memory.

The processor is designed to be pipelined, meaning that multiple instructions can be executed at the same time. The pipeline stages are:

1. **Fetch:** The instruction is fetched from the instruction memory.
2. **Decode:** The instruction is decoded and the control signals are generated.
3. **Execute:** The instruction is executed and the result is stored in the register file or the data memory.
4. **Write Back:** The result of the instruction is written back to the register file or the data memory.

The processor can execute up to two instructions per clock cycle.
