```verilog
module ComplexVerilogCode(input a, b, c, d, output x, y, z);

// Combinational Logic
assign x = a & b; // AND gate
assign y = c | d; // OR gate
assign z = ~x; // NOT gate

// Sequential Logic
reg [3:0] counter; // 4-bit counter

always @(posedge clk) begin
    // Increment counter
    counter <= counter + 1'b1;

    // Reset counter when it reaches maximum value
    if (counter == 4'b1111) begin
        counter <= 4'b0000;
    end
end

// Output logic based on counter value
assign output1 = (counter[0] & counter[2]); // Output 1 is true when bits 0 and 2 of the counter are both 1
assign output2 = (counter[1] | counter[3]); // Output 2 is true when either bit 1 or bit 3 of the counter is 1

endmodule
```

This Verilog code implements a complex digital circuit with both combinational and sequential logic. Here's an explanation of the code:

**Combinational Logic:**

- The combinational logic gates are used to perform basic Boolean operations on the input signals `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`.
 - `x` is the result of an AND operation between `a` and `b`.
 - `y` is the result of an OR operation between `c` and `d`.
 - `z` is the result of a NOT operation on `x`.

**Sequential Logic:**

- A 4-bit counter is implemented using a `reg` variable called `counter`.
 - The `always @(posedge clk)` block is a sequential block that executes every time the clock signal `clk` rises.
 - Inside the block, the counter is incremented by 1 every clock cycle.
 - When the counter reaches its maximum value (1111), it is reset to 0.

**Output Logic:**

- The output signals `output1` and `output2` are determined based on the value of the counter.
 - `output1` is true when both bits 0 and 2 of the counter are 1.
 - `output2` is true when either bit 1 or bit 3 of the counter is 1.

This code demonstrates the use of both combinational and sequential logic in a single Verilog module. It can be used to implement various digital circuits, such as counters, registers, and state machines.
