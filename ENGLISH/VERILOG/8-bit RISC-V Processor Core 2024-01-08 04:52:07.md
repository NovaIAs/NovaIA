/*
 * 8-bit RISC-V processor core
 *
 * This is a very simple 8-bit RISC-V processor core. It is designed
 * to be easy to understand and implement, and it is not intended to be
 * a high-performance processor.
 *
 * The core is based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA),
 * which is a free and open ISA that is designed for high performance
 * and low power consumption. The RISC-V ISA is a load-store architecture,
 * which means that all data must be loaded into registers before it can
 * be processed.
 *
 * The core consists of the following components:
 *
 * * A 16-bit program counter (PC)
 * * A 16-bit instruction register (IR)
 * * A 8-bit register file (RF)
 * * A 8-bit ALU
 * * A 8-bit shifter
 * * A 8-bit multiplier
 * * A 8-bit divider
 * * A 8-bit status register (SR)
 * * A 8-bit interrupt controller (IC)
 *
 * The core operates on a single clock cycle. The PC is incremented by 2
 * on each clock cycle, and the IR is loaded with the instruction at the
 * PC. The instruction is then decoded and executed.
 *
 * The RF is a 16-bit register file that contains the general-purpose
 * registers (GPRs). The GPRs are used to store data and addresses.
 *
 * The ALU is a 8-bit arithmetic logic unit that can perform addition,
 * subtraction, multiplication, and division. The ALU is also used to
 * perform logical operations, such as AND, OR, and XOR.
 *
 * The shifter is a 8-bit shifter that can shift data left or right. The
 * shifter is used to align data for arithmetic and logical operations.
 *
 * The multiplier is a 8-bit multiplier that can multiply two 8-bit numbers.
 * The multiplier is used to perform multiplication operations.
 *
 * The divider is a 8-bit divider that can divide two 8-bit numbers. The
 * divider is used to perform division operations.
 *
 * The SR is a 8-bit status register that contains the following flags:
 *
 * * Carry flag (C)
 * * Overflow flag (V)
 * * Zero flag (Z)
 * * Negative flag (N)
 *
 * The flags are used to indicate the results of arithmetic and logical
 * operations.
 *
 * The IC is a 8-bit interrupt controller that can handle up to 16
 * interrupts. The IC is used to handle interrupts from external devices.
 *
 * The core is designed to be easily expandable. It can be expanded to
 * support more GPRs, more instructions, and more peripherals.
