```sql
-- Create a temporary table to store the cumulative sum of sales for each product category
WITH CumulativeSales AS (
    SELECT
        product_category,
        SUM(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_category ORDER BY date ASC) AS cumulative_sales
    FROM sales_data
)

-- Create a temporary table to store the year-over-year growth rate for each product category
WITH YoYGrowth AS (
    SELECT
        product_category,
        (cumulative_sales - LAG(cumulative_sales, 12) OVER (PARTITION BY product_category ORDER BY date ASC)) / LAG(cumulative_sales, 12) OVER (PARTITION BY product_category ORDER BY date ASC) * 100 AS yoy_growth
    FROM CumulativeSales
)

-- Select the product category, cumulative sales, and year-over-year growth rate for the last date in the dataset
SELECT
    product_category,
    cumulative_sales,
    yoy_growth
FROM YoYGrowth
WHERE date = (SELECT MAX(date) FROM sales_data);
```

**Explanation:**

1. The first CTE, `CumulativeSales`, calculates the cumulative sum of sales for each product category. This is done by using the `SUM()` function with the `OVER()` clause, which allows us to calculate the sum of sales for each product category up to the current row.

2. The second CTE, `YoYGrowth`, calculates the year-over-year growth rate for each product category. This is done by subtracting the cumulative sales for the previous year from the current year, and then dividing that value by the cumulative sales for the previous year. The result is multiplied by 100 to get the percentage growth rate.

3. The final query selects the product category, cumulative sales, and year-over-year growth rate for the last date in the dataset. This is done by joining the `CumulativeSales` and `YoYGrowth` CTEs on the `product_category` column, and then filtering the results for the last date in the dataset.

This code is complex because it uses multiple CTEs and window functions to perform complex calculations on the data. It is also relatively long, as it includes a lot of intermediate steps to calculate the final result. However, it is a powerful example of how SQL can be used to perform complex data analysis tasks.
