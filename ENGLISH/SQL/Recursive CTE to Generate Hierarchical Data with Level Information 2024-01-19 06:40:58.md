This SQL code uses recursive CTE (#HierarchyWithLevels) to calculate the level of each node in a hierarchical structure.

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Create Temporary Table (#Hierarchy):**

   - The WITH Hierarchy AS statement creates a temporary table named #Hierarchy.
   - This temporary table contains four columns: ID, ParentID, NodeValue, and Level.
   - The data from the NodesTable is copied into the #Hierarchy table.
   - The Level column is initially set to 0 for all nodes.

2. **Create Recursive CTE (#HierarchyWithLevels):**

   - The WITH HierarchyWithLevels AS statement creates a recursive CTE (Common Table Expression).
   - It starts by selecting rows from the #Hierarchy table where ParentID is NULL. This represents the root nodes of the hierarchy.
   - The Level column for these root nodes is set to 0.
   - The UNION ALL operator is used to recursively combine the result of the previous query with itself.
   - In the recursive step, the CTE joins the #Hierarchy table with itself using the ParentID and ID columns.
   - The Level column is incremented by 1 for each level of the hierarchy.

3. **Select Data and Format as a Hierarchical List:**

   - The final SELECT statement retrieves data from the #HierarchyWithLevels CTE.
   - The CASE statement is used to format the NodeValue column based on the Level of each node.
   - Root nodes are displayed as is, while child nodes are indented with two spaces for each level of depth.
   - The data is ordered by Level and ID to display the hierarchy correctly.
