```sql
-- This SQL code demonstrates advanced data manipulation and analysis techniques.

-- Create a common table expression (CTE) called `joined_data` that joins three tables:
WITH joined_data AS (
    SELECT
        t1.customer_id,
        t1.product_id,
        t1.purchase_date,
        t1.quantity,
        t2.product_name,
        t3.customer_name
    FROM
        sales_data t1
    JOIN
        products t2 ON t1.product_id = t2.product_id
    JOIN
        customers t3 ON t1.customer_id = t3.customer_id
)

-- Select distinct customer names and product names from the `joined_data` CTE.
SELECT DISTINCT customer_name, product_name
FROM
    joined_data;

-- Select customer names, product names, and the total quantity purchased for each combination.
SELECT
    customer_name,
    product_name,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM
    joined_data
GROUP BY
    customer_name,
    product_name;

-- Select customer names, product names, and the average quantity purchased for each combination.
SELECT
    customer_name,
    product_name,
    AVG(quantity) AS average_quantity
FROM
    joined_data
GROUP BY
    customer_name,
    product_name;

-- Select customer names, product names, and the maximum quantity purchased for each combination.
SELECT
    customer_name,
    product_name,
    MAX(quantity) AS max_quantity
FROM
    joined_data
GROUP BY
    customer_name,
    product_name;

-- Select customer names, product names, and the minimum quantity purchased for each combination.
SELECT
    customer_name,
    product_name,
    MIN(quantity) AS min_quantity
FROM
    joined_data
GROUP BY
    customer_name,
    product_name;

-- Select customer names, product names, and the total revenue generated for each combination.
SELECT
    customer_name,
    product_name,
    SUM(quantity * unit_price) AS total_revenue
FROM
    joined_data
GROUP BY
    customer_name,
    product_name;

-- Select customer names, product names, and the average revenue generated for each combination.
SELECT
    customer_name,
    product_name,
    AVG(quantity * unit_price) AS average_revenue
FROM
    joined_data
GROUP BY
    customer_name,
    product_name;

-- Select customer names, product names, and the maximum revenue generated for each combination.
SELECT
    customer_name,
    product_name,
    MAX(quantity * unit_price) AS max_revenue
FROM
    joined_data
GROUP BY
    customer_name,
    product_name;

-- Select customer names, product names, and the minimum revenue generated for each combination.
SELECT
    customer_name,
    product_name,
    MIN(quantity * unit_price) AS min_revenue
FROM
    joined_data
GROUP BY
    customer_name,
    product_name;
```

**Explanation:**

1. The `joined_data` CTE joins three tables: `sales_data`, `products`, and `customers` to create a single dataset with information about customers, products, and sales.


2. The subsequent queries use the `joined_data` CTE to perform various data analysis tasks:

   - Selecting distinct customer and product names.


   - Calculating the total quantity purchased, average quantity purchased, maximum quantity purchased, and minimum quantity purchased for each customer-product combination.


   - Calculating the total revenue, average revenue, maximum revenue, and minimum revenue generated for each customer-product combination.


This complex SQL code demonstrates advanced data manipulation and analysis techniques, including CTEs, aggregation functions, and grouping. It provides a comprehensive analysis of customer purchase data, including insights into customer preferences, product popularity, and revenue trends.
