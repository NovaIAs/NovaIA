**Explanation:**

1. The ProductList and CustomerList CTEs are created to store the distinct values of the 'Product' and 'Customer' columns from the 'Sales' table, respectively.

2. The Hierarchy CTE is a recursive CTE that generates a hierarchical representation of the product-customer relationships.

3. The anchor member of the Hierarchy CTE selects the distinct values of 'Product' and 'Customer' from the 'Sales' table and sets the 'ParentProduct' column to NULL and the 'Level' column to 1 for the root level.

4. The recursive member of the Hierarchy CTE joins the 'Hierarchy' CTE with itself to find parent-child relationships. It sets the 'ParentProduct' column to the 'Product' column of the parent row and increments the 'Level' column for each level deeper in the hierarchy.

5. The final SELECT statement retrieves the 'Product', 'Customer', 'Level', and 'ParentProduct' columns from the Hierarchy CTE.

This code generates a hierarchical representation of the product-customer relationships, where each row represents a product-customer pair and its level in the hierarchy. The 'ParentProduct' column indicates the parent product for each product-customer pair, allowing you to traverse the hierarchy and identify relationships between products and customers.
