This complex SQL code implements a recursive common table expression (CTE) to perform a hierarchical query on an employee table. It calculates the level of each employee in the organization based on their managerial relationships.

The RecursiveCTE CTE is defined using a recursive subquery. It starts with the CEO (level 1) and then recursively finds all employees who report directly to the employees in the previous level. This process continues until all employees have been assigned a level.

The final result is a table that contains the employee ID, name, and level for all employees in the organization. The table is ordered by level in descending order, so the CEO is at the top of the hierarchy.

Explanation of the code:

1. The WITH statement is used to define a common table expression (CTE) named RecursiveCTE.
2. The SELECT statement inside the CTE selects the employeeId, managerId, name, and level columns from the Employee table.
3. The WHERE clause filters the results to include only employees with a level of 1, which represents the CEO.
4. The UNION ALL operator is used to combine the results of the first SELECT statement with the results of the recursive subquery.
5. The recursive subquery selects the employeeId, managerId, name, and level + 1 columns from the Employee table. The level + 1 expression increments the level for each employee who reports directly to the employees in the previous level.
6. The JOIN clause is used to join the Employee table with the RecursiveCTE CTE on the managerId and employeeId columns, respectively. This establishes the hierarchical relationship between employees and their managers.
7. The final SELECT statement outside the CTE selects the employeeId, name, and level columns from the RecursiveCTE CTE.
8. The ORDER BY clause is used to order the results by the level column in descending order. This ensures that the CEO is at the top of the hierarchy.

This complex SQL code provides a detailed view of the hierarchical structure of an organization, allowing for analysis of employee levels and reporting relationships.
