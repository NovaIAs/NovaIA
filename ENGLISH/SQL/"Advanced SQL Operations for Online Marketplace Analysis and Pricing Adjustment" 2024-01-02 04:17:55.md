Certainly! Here's a complex and unique SQL code that performs a series of operations on a hypothetical database of a fictional online marketplace:

```sql
-- Create a temporary table to store the order statistics
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE order_stats AS (
    SELECT
        o.customer_id,
        COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders,
        SUM(op.quantity) AS total_items_ordered,
        SUM(op.quantity * op.price) AS total_amount_spent
    FROM
        orders o
    INNER JOIN
        order_products op ON o.order_id = op.order_id
    GROUP BY
        o.customer_id
);

-- Create a view to display the top 10 customers based on total amount spent
CREATE VIEW top_customers AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        total_orders,
        total_items_ordered,
        total_amount_spent
    FROM
        order_stats
    ORDER BY
        total_amount_spent DESC
    LIMIT 10
);

-- Create a stored procedure to update product prices based on demand
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE update_product_prices()
BEGIN
    DECLARE done INT DEFAULT FALSE;
    DECLARE product_id INT;
    DECLARE demand INT;
    DECLARE price DECIMAL(10, 2);
    
    -- Declare cursor to iterate over products
    DECLARE cur CURSOR FOR SELECT product_id, COUNT(*) FROM order_products GROUP BY product_id;
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = TRUE;
    
    -- Open cursor
    OPEN cur;
    
    -- Loop through products
    read_loop: LOOP
        -- Fetch product data
        FETCH cur INTO product_id, demand;
        
        IF done THEN
            LEAVE read_loop;
        END IF;
        
        -- Calculate new price based on demand
        SET price = (SELECT AVG(price) FROM order_products WHERE product_id = product_id);
        SET price = CASE
            WHEN demand < 10 THEN price * 1.1
            WHEN demand < 50 THEN price * 1.05
            ELSE price
        END;
        
        -- Update product price
        UPDATE products SET price = price WHERE product_id = product_id;
    END LOOP;
    
    -- Close cursor
    CLOSE cur;
END//

DELIMITER ;

-- Execute stored procedure to update product prices
CALL update_product_prices();
```

This SQL code demonstrates a variety of advanced techniques. It starts by creating a temporary table called `order_stats`, which calculates various statistics for each customer, such as the total number of orders, total items ordered, and total amount spent.

Next, a view called `top_customers` is created, which selects the top 10 customers based on the total amount spent, ordering them in descending order.

After that, a stored procedure named `update_product_prices` is defined. This procedure uses a cursor to iterate over all the products in the `order_products` table and calculates a new price based on the demand (number of times the product appears in the orders). The procedure then updates the price of each product in the `products` table accordingly.

Finally, the stored procedure is called to update the product prices.

This code showcases advanced SQL concepts such as temporary tables, views, stored procedures, cursors, and conditional updates. It can be used in a real-world scenario to analyze customer behavior and dynamically adjust product prices based on demand.
