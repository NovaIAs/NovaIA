Explanation:

1. Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) called `tmp` that joins the `Orders`, `Customers`, `OrderDetails`, and `Products` tables to retrieve relevant details for each order.

2. Create another CTE called `cte_moving_average` to calculate a moving average of the quantity of each product over a window of three orders (`ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`).

3. Join the `tmp` and `cte_moving_average` CTEs on the `order_id` and `product_id` columns to associate the moving average with each order line.

4. Select the desired columns from `tmp` and `cte_moving_average` to display the order details, customer name, product name, quantity, unit price, and moving average.

5. Order the results by order date and order ID to present the data in a meaningful way.

Overall, this query retrieves order details, joins multiple tables, calculates moving averages, and joins the results to display the order information along with the moving average of product quantities over a window of three orders.
