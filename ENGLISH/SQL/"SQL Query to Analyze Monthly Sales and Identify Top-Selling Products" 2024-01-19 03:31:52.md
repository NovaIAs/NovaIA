```sql
-- This SQL code is used to perform a complex data analysis on a large dataset.

-- Create a temporary table called `tmp_sales` to store intermediate results.
CREATE TEMP TABLE tmp_sales AS
SELECT
    s.product_id,
    s.product_category,
    s.sales_date,
    s.sales_amount

        strftime('%Y-%m', sales_date) AS sales_month,
        SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
    FROM tmp_sales
    GROUP BY product_category, sales_month
),

-- Create a CTE called `top_selling_products` to find the top 5 products in each category based on total sales.

JOIN product_info pi ON tsp.product_id = pi.product_id
JOIN tmp_sales ts ON tsp.product_id = ts.product_id
WHERE ms.sales_month >= '2023-01' -- Filter results for sales months starting from January 2023

DROP TABLE tmp_sales;
```

Explanation:

1. The `tmp_sales` table is created to store intermediate results, such as the sales amount for each product and sales date.

2. The `monthly_sales` CTE is used to calculate the total sales for each product category for each month.

3. The `top_selling_products` CTE finds the top 5 products in each category based on total sales.

4. The `product_info` CTE retrieves additional product information, such as product names and prices.

5. The final query selects data from the CTEs and temporary tables to generate the final result, which includes the product category, sales month, product name, product price, and total sales.

6. The query is filtered to show results only for sales months starting from January 2023.

7. The results are ordered by sales month, product category, and total sales in descending order.

8. Finally, the `tmp_sales` table is dropped to clean up the temporary data.
