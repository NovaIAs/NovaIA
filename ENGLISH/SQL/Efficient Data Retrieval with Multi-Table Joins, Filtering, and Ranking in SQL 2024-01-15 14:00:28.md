```

Explanation:

1. **Temporary Table (tmp):**
   - This CTE (Common Table Expression) combines data from multiple tables using various join types and conditions.
   - It also includes a CASE statement to assign values based on a condition.

2. **Ranked CTE:**
   - This CTE calculates the rank of rows based on a complex expression.
   - It uses the PARTITION BY and ORDER BY clauses to group and sort the data before calculating the rank.

3. **Final Result:**
   - The query selects and displays the final results, including the columns from both CTEs.
   - It applies a WHERE clause to filter rows based on the rank, ensuring that only the top-ranked rows are displayed.

This code demonstrates a complex data retrieval scenario involving multiple table joins, filtering, and ranking. It showcases the flexibility and power of SQL in handling intricate data manipulations.
