This code creates a recursive common table expression (CTE) called `RecursiveCTE` that returns the employee hierarchy with additional information such as the level of each employee in the hierarchy. The CTE is defined using a recursive query that starts with employees who have no manager (i.e., those at the top of the hierarchy) and then recursively adds employees who report to those employees, and so on. The `Level` column indicates the level of each employee in the hierarchy, with the top-level employees having a level of 0.

The final query then joins the `RecursiveCTE` with the `Departments` table to add the department name for each employee. The result is a table that contains the employee ID, manager ID, full name, job title, department name, salary, and level for all employees in the company.

This code is complex because it uses a recursive CTE to traverse the employee hierarchy. Recursive CTEs can be difficult to understand and debug, especially for beginners. However, they can be a powerful tool for working with hierarchical data.

Here is an explanation of the code:

* The `WITH` clause defines the `RecursiveCTE` CTE.
* The first subquery in the `WITH` clause selects employees who have no manager (i.e., those at the top of the hierarchy). These employees are assigned a level of 0.
* The second subquery in the `WITH` clause recursively adds employees who report to the employees selected in the first subquery. The level of these employees is incremented by 1 for each level in the hierarchy.
* The `SELECT` statement at the end of the code joins the `RecursiveCTE` CTE with the `Departments` table to add the department name for each employee.

The result of this code is a table that contains the following columns:

* `EmployeeId`
* `ManagerId`
* `FullName`
* `JobTitle`
* `Department`
* `Salary`
* `Level`

This table can be used to answer a variety of questions about the employee hierarchy, such as:

* Who are the top-level employees in the company?
* Who reports to each employee?
* What is the level of each employee in the hierarchy?
* What is the average salary for employees at each level?
