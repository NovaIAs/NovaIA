Explanation:

1. RecursiveMaterializedView: This common table expression (CTE) creates a recursive materialized view named `RecursiveMaterializedView`, which calculates the hierarchical path and level for each territory. It starts with territories that have no parent (i.e., top-level territories) and then recursively adds child territories to the materialized view.

2. CTE_TerritoryHierarchy: This CTE groups the territories by their ID, name, parent ID, path, and level. It also calculates the `FullPath` column, which concatenates the territory names along the path, separated by a forward slash ('/'). This column provides a hierarchical representation of each territory's position within the territory hierarchy.

3. Final SELECT Statement: The final SELECT statement retrieves the territory data from the `CTE_TerritoryHierarchy` CTE, including the territory ID, name, parent ID, path, level, and the `FullPath` column. It orders the results by level (depth in the hierarchy) and territory name to provide a structured representation of the territory hierarchy.

This code demonstrates a complex SQL query in English that creates a recursive materialized view to efficiently calculate territory hierarchies. It then uses this materialized view to generate a hierarchical representation of territories, including their full paths within the hierarchy. This code can be useful for various applications, such as geographical region management, organizational structure visualization, and data analysis involving hierarchical structures.
