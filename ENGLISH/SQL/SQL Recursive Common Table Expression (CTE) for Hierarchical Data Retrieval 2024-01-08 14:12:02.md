This complex SQL code demonstrates a recursive common table expression (CTE) to retrieve hierarchical data from a table named "categories." Here's an explanation of the code:

1. **RecursiveCTE:** This is the CTE that performs the recursive query.

2. **Base Case:** The base case of the recursive CTE selects all categories that have a NULL parent_id, which represents the root nodes in the hierarchy. These root nodes are typically top-level categories or parent categories without a parent.

3. **Recursive Step:** The recursive step of the CTE uses a UNION ALL operation to join the results of the base case with itself. This allows the query to traverse down the hierarchy, selecting categories that have a parent_id matching the id of categories in the previous level.

4. **Level Column:** The level column is added to keep track of the level or depth of each category in the hierarchy. It starts at level 1 for root categories and increments by 1 for each level deeper in the hierarchy.

5. **Final SELECT:** The final SELECT statement retrieves the id, parent_id, name, and level columns from the RecursiveCTE.

6. **ORDER BY:** The results are ordered by the level column (ascending) and then by the name column (ascending) to display the categories in a hierarchical order, with child categories indented under their parent categories.

This complex code is useful for retrieving hierarchical data from a database, such as categories, organizational structures, or file system directories. It allows you to traverse the hierarchy recursively and retrieve data at various levels.
