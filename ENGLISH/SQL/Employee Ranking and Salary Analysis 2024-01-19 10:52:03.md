Explanation:

1. Common Table Expression (CTE) - RankedEmployees:
   - This CTE calculates the rank of each employee within their department based on their salary in descending order.
   - It uses the `RANK()` function over a window partition defined by the `DepartmentID` column to assign ranks.

2. Main Query:
   - Selects various employee information from the `RankedEmployees` CTE, including `EmployeeID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `DepartmentID`, `Salary`, and `RankWithinDepartment`.
   - It also calculates the average salary of employees in each department using the `AVG()` function over a window partition defined by the `DepartmentID` column.

3. Join:
   - Performs an INNER JOIN between the `RankedEmployees` CTE and the `Employees` table using the `EmployeeID` column to link employees from both tables.

This query retrieves detailed employee information, including their rank within their department and the average salary in their department. It provides a comprehensive view of employee performance and compensation across departments.
