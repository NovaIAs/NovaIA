```sql
WITH RecursiveCTE AS (
    SELECT

        parent_id,
        name,
        level
    FROM
        categories
    WHERE
        level = 1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
        c.id,
        c.parent_id,
        c.name,
        rcte.level + 1
    FROM
        categories c
    JOIN
        RecursiveCTE rcte ON c.parent_id = rcte.id

    RecursiveCTE rcte;
```

Explanation:

1. Recursive Common Table Expression (CTE):
   - RecursiveCTE: We define a recursive CTE named RecursiveCTE.
   - Base Case: The base case of the recursion is to select categories with level 1, which represent the top-level categories.
   - Recursive Case: The recursive case selects categories whose parent_id matches the id of a category in the RecursiveCTE. This allows us to traverse the categories hierarchy recursively.

2. Recursive Query:
   - The recursive query part uses the UNION ALL operator to combine the base case and recursive case results into a single result set.
   - The recursive query continues until there are no more categories to traverse.

3. Final Result:
   - The final result is the union of all the categories, including their ids, parent_ids, names, and levels, in a hierarchical structure.

This complex SQL code allows you to perform a recursive query on a hierarchical data structure, such as categories. It can be used to traverse the hierarchy and retrieve data from multiple levels of the hierarchy in a single query. This is particularly useful when working with hierarchical data models, such as organizational structures, product categories, or file systems.
