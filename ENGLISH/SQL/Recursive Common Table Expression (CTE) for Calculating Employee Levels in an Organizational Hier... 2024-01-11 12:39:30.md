```sql
WITH RecursiveCTE AS (
    SELECT *, 0 AS Level
    FROM Employees
    WHERE ManagerID IS NULL
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.*, rc.Level + 1
    FROM Employees e
    JOIN RecursiveCTE rc ON e.ManagerID = rc.EmployeeID
)

SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Level
FROM RecursiveCTE
ORDER BY Level;
```

This code is a recursive common table expression (CTE) in SQL that calculates the level of each employee in an organizational hierarchy. The CTE, named RecursiveCTE, is defined using the WITH clause. It starts with a base case that selects all employees who have no manager (i.e., they are at the top level of the hierarchy).

Then, the recursive part of the CTE is defined using the UNION ALL operator. This part selects all employees and their managers, and it increments the Level column by 1 for each level down the hierarchy. The recursive part continues until there are no more employees to select.

Finally, the SELECT statement outside the CTE is used to retrieve the EmployeeID, Name, and Level columns for all employees, ordered by their level in the hierarchy.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The RecursiveCTE CTE is defined with the WITH clause. It starts with a base case that selects all employees who have no manager (i.e., they are at the top level of the hierarchy).
- The recursive part of the CTE is defined using the UNION ALL operator. This part selects all employees and their managers, and it increments the Level column by 1 for each level down the hierarchy. The recursive part continues until there are no more employees to select.
- The SELECT statement outside the CTE is used to retrieve the EmployeeID, Name, and Level columns for all employees, ordered by their level in the hierarchy.
