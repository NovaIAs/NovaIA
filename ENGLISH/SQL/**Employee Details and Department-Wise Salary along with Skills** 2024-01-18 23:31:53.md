This code demonstrates a more complex and differentiated SQL query that combines multiple temporary tables, a CTE (Common Table Expression), and various joins to retrieve and aggregate data from different tables. The query calculates the total salary for each department and retrieves the employee's details along with their skills. The GROUP_CONCAT function is used to concatenate the employee's skills into a single string.

Here's a breakdown of the query:

1. **Create Temporary Tables:**

   Two temporary tables are created: `Employee` and `EmployeeSkill`. The `Employee` table stores employee details such as ID, name, department, salary, and date of birth. The `EmployeeSkill` table stores the skills associated with each employee.

2. **Insert Data:**

   Data is inserted into both temporary tables using `INSERT` statements.

3. **Create a CTE (Common Table Expression):**

   A CTE named `DepartmentSalary` is created using a subquery. It calculates the total salary for each department by grouping the employee salaries by their departments.

4. **Main Query:**

   The main query starts with a `SELECT` statement that retrieves various columns from the `Employee` table, including the employee's ID, name, department, salary, and date of birth.

5. **Joins:**

   The query uses a series of joins to combine data from different tables:
     - A `LEFT JOIN` is used to join the `Employee` table with the `DepartmentSalary` CTE based on the `Department` column. This allows the query to retrieve the total salary for each department.
     - Another `LEFT JOIN` is used to join the `Employee` table with the `EmployeeSkill` table based on the `EmployeeID` column. This allows the query to retrieve the skills associated with each employee.

6. **Aggregation and Grouping:**

   The query uses the `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by the employee's ID, name, department, salary, and date of birth.

7. **Concatenation:**

   The `GROUP_CONCAT` function is used to concatenate the skills associated with each employee into a single string.

8. **Drop Temporary Tables:**

   The `DROP TABLE` statements are used to drop the temporary tables after the query is executed.

This query demonstrates the use of more advanced SQL techniques, including temporary tables, CTEs, joins, aggregation, and concatenation.
