**Explanation:**

1. The `WITH` clause is used to create a temporary table called `RankedEmployeeData`. This table contains the results of a complex query that includes calculations for each employee, such as the running total of salaries in their department, the average salary in their department, and the percentage of their salary compared to the total salary of their department.


2. The `SELECT` statement in the main query selects data from the `RankedEmployeeData` temporary table and performs additional calculations, such as the difference between each employee's salary and the average salary in their department.


3. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only employees whose salary is greater than the average salary in their department.


4. The `ORDER BY` clause orders the results by department ID and salary in descending order.


This complex query allows you to analyze employee salary data in a variety of ways, such as identifying employees who are paid more than the average in their department or calculating the percentage of each employee's salary compared to the total salary of their department.
