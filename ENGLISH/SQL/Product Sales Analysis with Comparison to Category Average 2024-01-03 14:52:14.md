Explanation:

1. The first part of the code creates a temporary table called `tmp_table` using a subquery. This subquery calculates the total quantity sold for each product and filters the results to include only products with a quantity sold greater than 10.

2. The second part of the code creates a common table expression (CTE) called `ProductCategoryAverage`. This CTE calculates the average quantity sold for each product category.

3. The third part of the code uses a LEFT JOIN to join the `tmp_table` and `products` tables on the `product_id` column. It also joins the `ProductCategoryAverage` CTE on the `product_category` column.

4. The final SELECT statement selects the product_id, product_name, quantity_sold, product_category, and the difference between the quantity_sold and the average_quantity_sold for each product.

5. The DROP TABLE statement is used to drop the temporary table `tmp_table` after it is no longer needed.
