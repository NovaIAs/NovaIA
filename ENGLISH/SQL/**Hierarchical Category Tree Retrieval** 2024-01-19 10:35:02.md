Explanation:

This complex SQL code performs a recursive query to retrieve and display hierarchical data from the `categories` table. It uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) called `RecursiveCTE` to achieve this.

1. The `RecursiveCTE` is defined using a recursive query. It starts by selecting categories with a level of 0 (top-level categories). Then, it recursively joins the results with itself to fetch all child categories at subsequent levels.

2. The main `SELECT` statement retrieves data from the `RecursiveCTE`. It includes the `id`, `name`, and `level` columns for each category.

3. The `path` column is calculated using a subquery. It concatenates the names of all parent categories along the path to the current category, separated by ' > '. This provides a breadcrumb-style representation of the category hierarchy.

4. The `WHERE` clause in the subquery ensures that only parent categories with a level less than the current category's level are included in the path. This prevents circular references and ensures that the path is correctly constructed.

5. The final result set displays the category's `id`, `name`, `level`, and `path`, providing a hierarchical view of the categories with their full paths.

Overall, this code demonstrates a powerful recursive query technique in SQL to efficiently retrieve and display hierarchical data.
