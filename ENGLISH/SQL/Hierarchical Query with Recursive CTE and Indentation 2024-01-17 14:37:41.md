Explanation:

This SQL code snippet implements a recursive common table expression (CTE) to perform a hierarchical query on a table named 'hierarchy'. The hierarchy table is assumed to have columns called 'id', 'name', and 'parent_id', where 'id' is the unique identifier for each row, 'name' is the name of the item, and 'parent_id' is the foreign key referencing the parent item in the hierarchy.

The RecursiveCTE CTE is defined using a recursive query. It starts with a base case that selects all rows from the hierarchy table where the 'parent_id' is NULL. This represents the top-level items in the hierarchy.

The recursive part of the query uses a UNION ALL operator to join the base case with itself. This allows the CTE to traverse the hierarchy and include all levels of the hierarchy in the result set.

The ROW_NUMBER() function is used to assign a level number to each row in the hierarchy. The level number indicates the depth of the row in the hierarchy, with the top-level items having a level number of 1.

The outer query selects the 'id', 'name', and 'indentation' columns from the RecursiveCTE CTE. The 'indentation' column is calculated using a combination of the level number and a string of spaces. This indentation is used to format the output of the query so that the hierarchy is visually represented with proper indentation.

The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the results first by the level number and then by the 'id' column. This ensures that the rows are returned in a hierarchical order, with the top-level items appearing first followed by their child items.

When this code is executed, it will return a hierarchical representation of the data in the 'hierarchy' table, with each level of the hierarchy properly indented. This result can be useful for displaying hierarchical data in a structured and visually appealing manner.
