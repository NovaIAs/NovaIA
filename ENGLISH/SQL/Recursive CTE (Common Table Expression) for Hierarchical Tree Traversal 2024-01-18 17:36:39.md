This recursive CTE (Common Table Expression) generates a hierarchical representation of a tree structure stored in the `tree_table`. It starts with the root nodes (`parent_id` is NULL) and then recursively finds the children of each node until it reaches the leaf nodes. The `level` column indicates the depth of each node in the tree, with the root node at level 0 and its children at level 1, and so on.

The code complexity stems from the recursive nature of the CTE, which requires careful construction to ensure it accurately captures the hierarchical relationships in the tree data. Additionally, the use of subqueries and joins adds to the complexity of the code, especially for users who may be less familiar with advanced SQL concepts.

To understand the code, it's crucial to grasp the concept of recursive CTEs and how they are used to traverse hierarchical data structures. Breaking down the query step by step can aid in comprehension:

1. **Base Case:** The first part of the CTE, starting with `SELECT … WHERE parent_id IS NULL`, acts as the base case for the recursion. It selects the root nodes of the tree, which have no parent nodes.

2. **Recursive Case:** The second part of the CTE, starting with `UNION ALL SELECT …`, represents the recursive step. It selects the children of the nodes in the current level by joining the `tree_table` with the recursive CTE itself (`RecursiveCTE AS r`) on the `parent_id` column. The `level` column is incremented by 1 for each level in the tree.

3. **Final Result:** The last part of the query, after the CTE, simply selects the columns `id`, `parent_id`, `name`, and `level` from the recursive CTE, providing the final hierarchical representation of the tree data.

Overall, this code showcases a sophisticated use of recursive CTEs to navigate and extract information from a tree structure, making it a complex and intricate example of SQL programming.
