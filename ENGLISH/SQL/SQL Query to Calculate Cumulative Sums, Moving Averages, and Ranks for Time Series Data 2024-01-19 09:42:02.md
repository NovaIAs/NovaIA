Explanation:

1. The first CTE, `tmp_data`, is created to calculate the difference between the current value and the previous value for each data point.

2. The second CTE, `CumulativeSums`, calculates the cumulative sum and moving average of the value differences for each `id`.

3. The third CTE, `RankedSums`, calculates the ranks of the cumulative sums and moving averages within each `id`.

4. Finally, the desired columns are selected from the `RankedSums` CTE and displayed as the output.
