Explanation:

1. **RecursiveCTE:** This Common Table Expression (CTE) assigns a row number (`rn`) to each row in `Table1` partitioned by the `ID` column and ordered by the `Date` column. This helps in identifying the first row for each `ID` and `Date` combination.

2. **FilteredCTE:** This CTE filters the `RecursiveCTE` to only include the first row for each `ID` and `Date` combination, effectively selecting the most recent data for each record.

3. **JoinedCTE:** This CTE performs a left join between `FilteredCTE` and `Table2` using the `ID` and `Date` columns. It retrieves the current value from `FilteredCTE` and the previous value from `Table2` by subtracting one day from the current date.

4. **Final Query:** The final query retrieves the `ID`, `Date`, `Value`, `PreviousValue`, and a calculated column `ChangeIndicator` that indicates whether the value increased, decreased, or remained unchanged compared to the previous value. The query orders the results by `ID` and `Date`.

This complex SQL code essentially provides a detailed analysis of data changes over time for each unique `ID` in `Table1`. It identifies the most recent value and the previous value for each record and categorizes the change as an increase, decrease, or no change. This type of analysis is commonly used in data analytics, financial reporting, and trend analysis scenarios.
