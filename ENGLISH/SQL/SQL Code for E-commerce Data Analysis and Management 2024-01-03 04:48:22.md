Certainly! Here's a complex and unique SQL code that performs various operations on a hypothetical e-commerce database:

```sql
-- Create a temporary table to store the top 5 categories based on sales quantity
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE top_categories AS (
  SELECT c.category_id, c.category_name, SUM(o.quantity) AS total_sales
  FROM categories c
  JOIN products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
  JOIN order_items o ON p.product_id = o.product_id
  GROUP BY c.category_id
  ORDER BY total_sales DESC
  LIMIT 5
);

-- Create a view to display the top-selling products in the top categories
CREATE VIEW top_selling_products AS (
  SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name, c.category_name, SUM(o.quantity) AS total_sales
  FROM products p
  JOIN order_items o ON p.product_id = o.product_id
  JOIN top_categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
  GROUP BY p.product_id
  ORDER BY total_sales DESC
);

-- Create a stored procedure to update the product prices in a category
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE update_product_prices(IN category_id INT, IN price_increase DECIMAL(10, 2))
BEGIN
  UPDATE products
  SET price = price + price_increase
  WHERE category_id = category_id;
END//
DELIMITER ;

-- Calculate the average order value for each customer
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, AVG(o.order_total) AS average_order_value
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id;

-- Find customers who have made at least 3 orders in the past month
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
GROUP BY c.customer_id
HAVING order_count >= 3;

-- Generate a report showing the total revenue per month for the past year
SELECT YEAR(o.order_date) AS year, MONTH(o.order_date) AS month, SUM(o.order_total) AS total_revenue
FROM orders o
WHERE o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
GROUP BY YEAR(o.order_date), MONTH(o.order_date)
ORDER BY year, month;

-- Delete all products that have never been ordered
DELETE FROM products
WHERE product_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM order_items);

-- Drop the temporary table and view
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS top_categories;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS top_selling_products;
```

Explanation:
1. The code first creates a temporary table named "top_categories" to store the top 5 categories based on sales quantity. It calculates the total sales for each category by joining the "categories," "products," and "order_items" tables and sorts them in descending order.

2. Then, a view named "top_selling_products" is created to display the top-selling products within the top categories. It calculates the total sales for each product by joining the "products," "order_items," and "top_categories" tables and sorts them in descending order.

3. A stored procedure named "update_product_prices" is defined to update the prices of products in a specified category. It takes the category ID and the price increase as input parameters and updates the prices accordingly.

4. The code calculates the average order value for each customer by joining the "customers" and "orders" tables and grouping them by customer ID.

5. It finds customers who have made at least 3 orders in the past month by joining the "customers" and "orders" tables, applying a date filter, and grouping them by customer ID. The "HAVING" clause filters for customers with at least 3 orders.

6. A report is generated showing the total revenue per month for the past year. It joins the "orders" table, applies a date filter, groups the results by year and month, and calculates the sum of the order totals.

7. All products that have never been ordered are deleted from the "products" table by using a subquery to identify products that are not present in the "order_items" table.

8. Finally, the temporary table and view created earlier are dropped to clean up the database.
