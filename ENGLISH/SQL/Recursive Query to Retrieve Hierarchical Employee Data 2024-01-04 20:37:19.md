Explanation:

1. The RecursiveCTE common table expression (CTE) is defined as a recursive query that starts with the root-level employees (those with no manager) and then recursively retrieves their subordinates at each level.

2. The initial query in the RecursiveCTE selects employees with a NULL ManagerId, effectively finding the top-level employees. It includes their EmployeeId, ManagerId (which is NULL for these employees), FirstName, LastName, Salary, and initializes their Level to 0.

3. The recursive part of the CTE uses a UNION ALL operation to combine the initial results with subsequent recursive queries. It selects employees whose ManagerId matches the EmployeeId of employees already included in the CTE. For these employees, it retrieves their EmployeeId, ManagerId, FirstName, LastName, Salary, and increments their Level by 1 compared to their manager's level.

4. The final SELECT statement retrieves the data from the RecursiveCTE and orders the results by Level (ascending) and LastName (ascending). This provides a hierarchical view of the employee data, with managers appearing before their subordinates and employees within each level sorted alphabetically by last name.

This code performs a recursive query to retrieve hierarchical data from an employee table, where each employee has a unique EmployeeId and a ManagerId that references their manager's EmployeeId. It calculates the level of each employee in the hierarchy, starting from level 0 for the root-level employees and incrementing the level for each level of subordinates. The result is a hierarchical representation of the employee data, which can be used for various purposes, such as organizational charting or reporting.
