This code demonstrates a recursive common table expression (CTE) in SQL to perform a hierarchical query on a categories table. Here's an explanation of each part of the code:

WITH RecursiveCTE AS (...):
This line starts the definition of a recursive CTE named RecursiveCTE.

SELECT *,...:
This line selects various columns from the Categories table, including ID, Name, ParentID, as well as calculated columns Ordinal and Level.

ROW_NUMBER():
The ROW_NUMBER() function is used to assign an ordinal number to each row within each parent category. This is done using a partition by ParentID and then ordering by Sequence.

SUM(1):
The SUM(1) function is used to calculate the level of each category in the hierarchy. It sums up the number of rows from the root category to the current category.

FROM Categories WHERE ParentID IS NULL:
This line selects the root categories (categories with no parent) from the Categories table. This serves as the base case for the recursion.

UNION ALL:
This line combines the results of the base case with the recursive part of the CTE.

SELECT *,...:
This line again selects various columns from RecursiveCTE, including the calculated columns Ordinal and Level.

FROM RecursiveCTE INNER JOIN Categories...:
This line performs a self-join on the RecursiveCTE. It joins each category with its parent category using the ParentID column.

SELECT ID, Name, ParentID, Ordinal, Level FROM RecursiveCTE;:
This line selects the columns ID, Name, ParentID, Ordinal, and Level from the RecursiveCTE.

This code allows you to query a hierarchical structure like categories with multiple levels and display the categories along with their ordinal position and level in the hierarchy.
