**Explanation:**

1. **Create Temporary Table (IntermediateResults):**

   - We start by creating a temporary table called `IntermediateResults` using the `CREATE TEMP TABLE` statement. This table will store the results of the subquery that calculates the total sales for each product in each region.

2. **Subquery to Calculate Total Sales:**

   - The subquery within the `CREATE TEMP TABLE` statement calculates the total sales for each product in each region. It joins the `Products`, `Sales`, and `Regions` tables to achieve this.

   - For each unique combination of `ProductID`, `ProductName`, `RegionID`, and `RegionName`, it calculates the sum of the `SalesAmount` column using the `SUM()` aggregate function. This gives us the total sales for each product in each region.

3. **Retrieve Top 5 Products per Region:**

   - The main `SELECT` statement retrieves the top 5 products with the highest total sales for each region. It uses the `IntermediateResults` temporary table as its data source.

   - The `WHERE` clause uses a subquery to find the top 5 products in each region based on total sales. The subquery calculates the maximum total sales (`MaxTotalSales`) for each region and then selects the top 5 regions with the highest `MaxTotalSales`.

   - The `IN` operator is used to filter the `IntermediateResults` table and select only those rows where the `RegionID` and `TotalSales` match the top 5 products in each region identified by the subquery.

This complex SQL code allows us to efficiently identify the top-selling products in different regions and provides a clear and organized way to present the results.
