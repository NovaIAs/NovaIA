This code is a collection of type-level functions that compute various combinatorial quantities. The functions are defined using type families, which allow us to define functions that operate on types. The functions are all defined in a modular way, so that they can be easily combined to compute more complex quantities.

The code is organized into several sections, each of which contains functions that compute a particular type of combinatorial quantity. The sections are:

* **Factorials:** Functions for computing the factorial of a natural number.
* **Binomial Coefficients:** Functions for computing the binomial coefficient of two natural numbers.
* **Combinations:** Functions for computing the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements.
* **Permutations:** Functions for computing the number of ways to arrange k elements from a set of n elements in a specific order.
* **Partitions:** Functions for computing the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets.
* **Distributions:** Functions for computing the number of ways to distribute n identical objects into k distinct boxes, allowing for empty boxes.
* **Restricted Distributions:** Functions for computing the number of ways to distribute n identical objects into k distinct boxes, disallowing empty boxes.
* **Circular Permutations:** Functions for computing the number of ways to arrange n objects in a circle.
* **Restricted Circular Permutations:** Functions for computing the number of ways to arrange n objects in a circle, such that no two adjacent objects are the same.
* **Partitions with Condition:** Functions for computing the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets, such that each subset contains at least one specific element.
* **Distributions with Condition:** Functions for computing the number of ways to distribute n identical objects into k distinct boxes, allowing for empty boxes, such that each box contains at least one object.
* **Restricted Distributions with Condition:** Functions for computing the number of ways to distribute n identical objects into k distinct boxes, disallowing empty boxes, such that each box contains at least one object.

Each function is defined using a type family, which allows us to define functions that operate on types. The type family is defined using a set of rules, which specify how the function should be evaluated for different types. The rules are written using a combination of type constructors and type variables.

For example, the `Factorial` type family is defined using the following rules:

```haskell
type family Factorial (n :: Nat) :: Nat where
  Factorial 'Z = 'S 'Z
  Factorial ('S n) = n * Factorial n
```

The first rule states that the factorial of zero is one. The second rule states that the factorial of a natural number `n` is `n` times the factorial of `n-1`.

The `Binomial` type family is defined using the following rules:

```haskell
type family Binomial (n :: Nat) (k :: Nat) :: Nat where
  Binomial n 'Z = 'S 'Z
  Binomial ('S n) ('S k) = Factorial n `div` (Factorial k * Factorial (n - k))
```

The first rule states that the binomial coefficient of `n` and `0` is one. The second rule states that the binomial coefficient of `n` and `k` is the factorial of `n` divided by the product of the factorial of `k` and the factorial of `n-k`.

The `Combinations` type family is defined using the following rules:

```haskell
type family Combinations (n :: Nat) (k :: Nat) :: Nat where
  Combinations n k = Binomial n k
```

The only rule states that the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements is the binomial coefficient of `n` and `k`.

The `Permutations` type family is defined using the following rules:

```haskell
type family Permutations (n :: Nat) (k :: Nat) :: Nat where
  Permutations n k = Factorial n `div` Factorial (n - k)
```

The only rule states that the number of ways to arrange `k` elements from a set of `n` elements in a specific order is the factorial of `n` divided by the factorial of `n-k`.
