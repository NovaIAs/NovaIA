**Explanation:**

This code defines a type for graphs, paths, and a function to find all paths between two nodes in a graph. It also defines a function to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. The code then provides an example usage of these functions, which includes defining a graph, specifying the source and destination nodes, and printing the results.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Defining the Graph Type:**

   ```haskell
   type Graph = Map String (Set String)
   ```

   This line defines the graph type as a map from strings (representing nodes) to sets of strings (representing neighbors).

2. **Defining the Path Type:**

   ```haskell
   type Path = [String]
   ```

   This line defines the path type as a list of strings (representing nodes).

3. **Function to Find All Paths:**

   ```haskell
   findAllPaths :: Graph -> String -> String -> [Path]
   ```

   This function takes a graph, a source node, and a destination node as input and returns a list of all paths between the source and destination nodes.

   Inside the function, a helper function `findPaths` is defined, which recursively finds all paths from a given node to the destination node.

   The `findPaths` function takes a node and a set of neighbors as input and returns a list of paths from the node to the destination.

   If the current node is the destination, it returns a path containing only the destination. Otherwise, it recursively finds all paths from each neighbor to the destination and concatenates them with the current node.

4. **Function to Find the Shortest Path:**

   ```haskell
   findShortestPath :: Graph -> String -> String -> Path
   ```

   This function takes a graph, a source node, and a destination node as input and returns the shortest path between the source and destination nodes.

   It first finds all paths between the source and destination using the `findAllPaths` function. If there are no paths, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it returns the shortest path by sorting the paths by length and taking the first one.

5. **Example Usage:**

   The provided example defines a graph, specifies the source and destination nodes, and prints the results.

   - The graph is defined using a map literal, where each key-value pair represents a node and its neighbors.

   - The source and destination nodes are specified using the `src` and `dst` variables, respectively.

   - The `findAllPaths` and `findShortestPath` functions are called with the graph, source, and destination nodes as arguments, and the results are printed.

This code demonstrates how to work with graphs, find all paths between two nodes, and find the shortest path between two nodes in Haskell.
