This code is a complete implementation of the game of blackjack in Haskell. It includes functions to create a standard deck of cards, shuffle the deck, deal a hand of cards to a player, calculate the score of a hand of cards, check if a hand of cards is a blackjack or a bust, get the winner of a hand of cards, and play a game of blackjack.

The code is well-commented and easy to understand. It uses a variety of Haskell features, including pattern matching, recursion, and monads.

Here is a brief explanation of the code:

* The `Card` data type represents a card in a deck of cards.
* The `Deck` type represents a deck of cards.
* The `standardDeck` function creates a standard deck of 52 cards.
* The `shuffleDeck` function shuffles a deck of cards.
* The `dealHand` function deals a hand of cards to a player.
* The `scoreHand` function calculates the score of a hand of cards.
* The `isBlackjack` function checks if a hand of cards is a blackjack.
* The `isBust` function checks if a hand of cards is a bust.
* The `isTie` function checks if two hands of cards are a tie.
* The `getWinner` function gets the winner of a hand of cards.
* The `playBlackjack` function plays a game of blackjack.
* The `dealerTurn` function is the dealer's turn in the game of blackjack.
* The `Player` data type represents a player in the game of blackjack.
* The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It calls the `playBlackjack` function to play a game of blackjack.
