**Task:** Develop a Haskell code that performs the following complex and differentiated tasks:

**1. Data Structures:**
   - Create a custom data type called `Shape` to represent various geometric shapes.
   - Define subtypes for `Shape`, including `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle`.

**2. Shape Properties:**
   - For each shape subtype, define functions to calculate specific properties.
     - For `Circle`: radius, area, circumference.
     - For `Rectangle`: length, width, area, perimeter.
     - For `Triangle`: base, height, area, perimeter.

**3. Shape Drawing:**
   - Develop a function called `drawShape` that takes a `Shape` as an argument and prints a representation of the shape to the console.
     - For `Circle`: Print "Circle with radius <radius>".
     - For `Rectangle`: Print "Rectangle with length <length> and width <width>".
     - For `Triangle`: Print "Triangle with base <base> and height <height>".

**4. Shape Comparison:**
   - Implement a function called `compareShapes` that compares two `Shape` objects and returns the shape with the larger area.

**5. Shape List Processing:**
   - Define a function `processShapes` that takes a list of `Shape` objects and performs the following operations:
     - Calculate the total area of all shapes in the list.
     - Find the shape with the smallest circumference (if applicable).
     - Print the details of the shape with the largest area.

**6. Main Function:**
   - Create a `main` function that does the following:
     - Creates a list of various shapes (e.g., circles, rectangles, and triangles).
     - Calls the `processShapes` function to perform calculations and print results.

**Explanation:**
This Haskell code demonstrates complex data structures, function definitions, pattern matching, and list processing. It provides a comprehensive solution for manipulating and analyzing a variety of geometric shapes, including circles, rectangles, and triangles. The code is well-organized, modular, and easy to understand, making it a valuable resource for learning Haskell and solving complex programming problems.
