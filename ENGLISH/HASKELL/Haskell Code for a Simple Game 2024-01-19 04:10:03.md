This code implements a simple game in Haskell. The game is played by two or more players, each of whom has a set of cells. The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach a certain number of points.

The code is divided into several modules. The first module, `Cell`, defines the data type of a cell. A cell can be either a `Turn` cell, which indicates that it is the turn of a particular player, or a `Cell` cell, which contains a measurement and a player.

The second module, `Player`, defines the data type of a player. A player has a name and a rank.

The third module, `Request`, defines the data type of a request. A request can be either a `Request` cell, which indicates that a player is requesting a measurement, or a `NoRequest` cell, which indicates that a player is not requesting anything.

The fourth module, `Response`, defines the data type of a response. A response can be either a `Response` cell, which contains a measurement and a message, or a `NoResponse` cell, which contains no data.

The fifth module, `User`, defines the data type of a user. A user has a player and a list of cells.

The sixth module, `Game`, defines the data type of a game. A game has a list of players, a list of cells, a turn cell, a map of players to their cells, a map of players to their ranks, and a list of winners.

The seventh module, `main`, is the main module of the program. It creates a new game and prints it to the console.

The code is written in a functional style, which means that it uses immutable data structures and pure functions. This makes the code easy to read and understand.
