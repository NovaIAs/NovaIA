This code is a collection of functions that take a list of strings as input and return a list of strings as output. Each function sorts the input list of strings according to a different criterion. For example, the function `sortByLength` sorts the input list of strings by their length, while the function `sortByFirstCharacter` sorts the input list of strings by their first character.

The code also includes a number of helper functions that are used by the sorting functions. For example
