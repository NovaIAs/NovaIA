This code defines a simple calculator program in Haskell. The program first reads two input numbers from the user, then converts them to integers, and then performs the addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division operation on them, depending on the user's choice. The result is then printed to the console.

The program uses the `getLine` function to read the input numbers from the user. The `read` function is then used to convert the input strings to integers. The `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators are used to perform the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations, respectively. The `show` function is used to convert the result to a string before it is printed to the console.

The program also defines four helper functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. These functions are used to perform the four basic arithmetic operations on two numbers. The `add` function adds two numbers, the `subtract` function subtracts two numbers, the `multiply` function multiplies two numbers, and the `divide` function divides two numbers. These helper functions are used by the `main` function to perform the calculations.
