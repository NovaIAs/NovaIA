This code is a Haskell program that plays the card game of poker. It uses a standard deck of 52 cards, and deals three hands of five cards each. It then finds the best hand out of the three, and prints it to the console.

The code is complex, but it is well-written and easy to understand. It uses a number of Haskell features, such as list comprehensions, pattern matching, and higher-order functions.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The `Deck` type is defined as a list of `Card`s.
* The `Card` type is an enumerated type that represents the different cards in a standard deck.
* The `standardDeck` function creates a standard deck of 52 cards.
* The `shuffleDeck` function shuffles a deck of cards.
* The `dealHand` function deals a hand of cards.
* The `bestHand` function finds the best hand in a list of hands.
* The `handRank` function ranks a hand of cards.
* The `groupBy` function groups a list of cards by their rank.
* The `countCard` function counts the number of occurrences of a card in a hand.
* The `mostFrequentCard` function finds the most frequently occurring card in a hand.
* The `secondMostFrequentCard` function finds the second most frequently occurring card in a hand.
* The `highestCard` function finds the highest card in a hand.
* The `lowestCard` function finds the lowest card in a hand.
* The `printBestHand` function prints the best hand in a list of hands.
* The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It creates a standard deck of cards, deals three hands of five cards each, finds the best hand out of the three, and prints it to the console.
