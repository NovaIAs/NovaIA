```haskell
-- This Haskell code defines a function called "findOptimalPath" that takes a list of cities as input and returns the shortest path that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

-- The "data City" declaration defines a custom data type called "City" that represents a city with two fields: "name" (the name of the city as a string) and "neighbors" (a list of the neighboring cities that can be reached from the current city).

data City = City {
    name :: String,
    neighbors :: [City]
}

-- The "findOptimalPath" function takes a list of cities as its input and returns the shortest path that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. It uses a recursive algorithm to explore all possible paths and find the one with the minimum total distance.

This code essentially finds the shortest Hamiltonian cycle in a graph, where the graph is represented by the list of cities and the distances between them are calculated using the Euclidean distance formula. The function works by recursively exploring all possible paths, starting from each city, and keeping track of the shortest path found so far. It uses a helper function called "findShortestPath" to find the shortest path from a given city to all other cities, while avoiding revisiting any cities that have already been visited. The function "minimumBy" is used to select the path with the minimum total distance among all the possible paths.
