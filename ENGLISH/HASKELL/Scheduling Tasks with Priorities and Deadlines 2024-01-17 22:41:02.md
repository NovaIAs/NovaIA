This code implements a complex and differentiated algorithm to schedule a list of tasks. The algorithm takes into account the priority and deadline of each task, and it schedules the tasks in such a way that the most important tasks are completed first, and the tasks with the earliest deadlines are completed before their deadlines.

The code first defines a data type to represent a task, and then it defines a function to generate a random task. The function `randomTask` uses the `randomRIO` function from the `System.Random` library to generate random values for the task's ID, priority, duration, and deadline.

Next, the code defines two functions to compare two tasks based on their priority and deadline, respectively. These functions are used by the `sortBy` function to sort the list of tasks.

The function `scheduleTasks` takes a list of tasks as input and schedules them one by one. The function first sorts the tasks by priority, and then it schedules the tasks one by one. For each task, the function prints the task, simulates the execution of the task, and checks if the task was completed before its deadline.

The function `delay` is used to simulate the execution of a task. The function takes the duration of the task in minutes as input and delays the execution of the function for the specified amount of time.

The function `currentTime` is used to get the current time in milliseconds. The function uses the `getPOSIXTime` function from the `System.POSIX` library to get the current time.

Finally, the code generates a list of 10 random tasks and schedules them.
