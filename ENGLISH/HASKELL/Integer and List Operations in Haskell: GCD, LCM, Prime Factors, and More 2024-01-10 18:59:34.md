This code is a collection of functions for working with integers and lists of integers. The functions include finding the greatest common divisor (GCD), least common multiple (LCM), prime factors, and unique prime factors. The code also includes functions for working with lists of pairs of integers, lists of lists of integers, and lists of matrices of integers.

The code is complex and differentiated because it covers a wide range of topics and includes a variety of functions. The code is also well-commented, which makes it easy to understand and use.

Here are some examples of how the code can be used:

* To find the GCD of two integers, you can use the `gcd` function. For example, `gcd 12 18` will return 6.
* To find the LCM of two integers, you can use the `lcm` function. For example, `lcm 12 18` will return 36.
* To find the prime factors of an integer, you can use the `primeFactors` function. For example, `primeFactors 12` will return `[2, 2, 3]`.
* To find the unique prime factors of a list of integers, you can use the `uniquePrimeFactors` function. For example, `uniquePrimeFactors [12, 18, 24]` will return `[2, 3]`.

The code can be used to solve a variety of problems involving integers and lists of integers. For example, the code can be used to find the greatest common divisor of a list of numbers, the least common multiple of a list of numbers, and the unique prime factors of a list of numbers. The code can also be used to solve problems involving lists of pairs of integers, lists of lists of integers, and lists of matrices of integers.
