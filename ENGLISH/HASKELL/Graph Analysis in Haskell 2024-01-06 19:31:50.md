This code is a complex and differentiated Haskell program that can be used to analyze graphs. It can find all paths from a starting node to a destination node, find all simple cycles in a graph, and find the strongly connected components of a graph.

The program first defines a few types and functions that are used by the main function. The `Graph` type is a map from a node to a list of its neighbors. The `findPaths` function finds all paths from a starting node to a destination node in a graph. The `findCycles` function finds all simple cycles in a graph. The `findStronglyConnectedComponents` function finds the strongly connected components of a graph. The `readGraph` function reads a graph from a file. The `printGraph` function prints a graph to the console.

The main function first reads a graph from a file. Then, it prints the graph to the console. Next, it finds all paths from a starting node to a destination node and prints them to the console. Then, it finds all simple cycles in the graph and prints them to the console. Finally, it finds the strongly connected components of the graph and prints them to the console.

This program is a powerful tool for analyzing graphs. It can be used to solve a variety of problems, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes, finding all cycles in a graph, and finding the strongly connected components of a graph.
