This code implements three classic graph algorithms: Floyd-Warshall, Kruskal, and Dijkstra. These algorithms are used to solve a variety of problems related to finding shortest paths and minimum spanning trees in graphs.

The code is written in Haskell, a functional programming language. Haskell is known for its conciseness and expressiveness, making it a good choice for writing complex algorithms.

The code is divided into three sections, one for each algorithm. Each section begins with a type declaration, followed by the algorithm itself. The algorithm is implemented using a combination of list comprehensions, pattern matching, and recursion.

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph. The algorithm works by iteratively updating a matrix of distances between vertices. The matrix is initialized with the distances between adjacent vertices, and then it is updated to include the distances between all pairs of vertices, even if they are not adjacent.

The Kruskal algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph. A spanning tree is a subgraph of a graph that connects all of the vertices in the graph, and a minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree with the smallest total weight. The Kruskal algorithm works by starting with a forest of trees, each containing a single vertex. The algorithm then repeatedly merges the two trees with the smallest edge between them, until there is only one tree left.

The Dijkstra algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph. The algorithm works by iteratively updating a list of distances from the starting vertex to all other vertices in the graph. The list is initialized with the distance from the starting vertex to itself, which is 0. The algorithm then repeatedly updates the list to include the distances from the starting vertex to all other vertices, even if they are not directly connected to the starting vertex.

The code is well-commented and easy to read, making it a good example of how to write complex algorithms in Haskell.
