This code first defines the `cluster` function, which takes a list of elements and returns a list of clusters, where a cluster is a list of elements with the same value. The `clusterize` function then takes a list of elements and a similarity function and returns a list of clusters, where a cluster is a set of elements that are similar to each other. The `jaccardSimilarity` function computes the Jaccard similarity between two sets of elements. The `pairs` function takes a list of elements and returns a list of pairs of elements. The `while` function repeatedly applies a list of actions to a value until a condition is no longer true. The `maximumBy` function takes a comparison function and a list of elements and returns the element that is the maximum according to the comparison function.

The `sim` function defines the similarity function used to cluster the vectors. In this case, we are using the cosine similarity between two vectors. The `main` function reads the input data from a file, parses the input data into a list of vectors, clusters the vectors using the cosine similarity function, and prints the clusters to the console.
