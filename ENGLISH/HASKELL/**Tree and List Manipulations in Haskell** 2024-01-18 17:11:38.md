**Explanation:**

This Haskell code defines a module called `ComplexHaskell` that contains various functions for working with trees and lists. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. **Data Types:**
    - `Tree a`: This is a data type that represents a generic tree with values of type `a`. A tree can be either a `Leaf` containing a single value or a `Node` containing a value and a list of child trees.

2. **Tree Functions:**
    - `treeToList`: Converts a tree into a list by performing a depth-first traversal.
    - `treeHeight`: Calculates the height of a tree by recursively finding the maximum height of its subtrees.
    - `treeMirror`: Creates a mirror image of a tree by recursively reversing the order of its child trees.
    - `treeInsert`: Inserts a value into a tree while maintaining the order of the values.

3. **List Functions:**
    - `listToTree`: Converts a sorted list of values into a binary search tree.
    - `uniqueList`: Removes duplicate elements from a list and sorts the list in ascending order.

4. **Main Function:**
    - The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It defines a binary search tree `tree` and demonstrates the usage of the tree functions and list functions.

This code demonstrates various tree and list manipulation operations in Haskell, including converting a list to a tree, finding the height of a tree, creating a mirror image of a tree, inserting values into a tree, removing duplicates from a list, and sorting a list.
