Explanation:

* The code defines a data type called `Task` that represents a task with fields for the task name, description, priority, due date, and status.
* It also defines a data type called `Day` that represents a day and a data type called `Status` that represents the status of a task.
* The code defines a function called `parseTask` that parses a string into a `Task`.
* It also defines a function called `sortTasks` that sorts a list of tasks by their due date and priority.
* The code defines a function called `printTasks` that prints a list of tasks.
* The main function parses the command-line arguments into a list of tasks, sorts the tasks, and then prints the sorted tasks.
