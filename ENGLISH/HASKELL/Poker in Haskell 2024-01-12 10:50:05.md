This code implements a poker game in Haskell. It includes the following features:

* A `Card` data type representing a card with a suit and a rank.
* A `Deck` data type representing a deck of cards as a set of `Card`s.
* A `dealHand` function to deal a hand of cards from a deck.
* An `evaluateHand` function to evaluate a hand of cards and determine the best possible hand from the given hand.
* A `compareHands` function to compare two hands and determine the better hand.
* A `compareCards` function to compare the cards in two hands and determine the better hand.
* A `compareRanks` function to compare the ranks of two sets of cards and determine the better hand.
* Instances of the `Eq`, `Ord`, and `Show` typeclasses for the `HandType` and `Hand` data types.
* A `main` function to deal a hand of cards, evaluate the hand, and print the hand and the remaining deck.

The code is well-commented and easy to understand. It uses Haskell's powerful type system and pattern matching to implement a complex game in a concise and elegant way.
