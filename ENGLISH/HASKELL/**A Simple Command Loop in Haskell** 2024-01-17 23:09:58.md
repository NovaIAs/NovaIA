-- Define a type alias for a list of strings

    Help -> do
      putStrLn "Available commands: help, quit, run"
      startLoop
    Quit -> return ()
    Run cmd -> do

  startLoop
```

This code defines a simple command loop in Haskell. The loop allows the user to enter commands, which are then executed. Available commands include "help", "quit", and "run". The "help" command displays a list of available commands. The "quit" command exits the loop. The "run" command executes a specified command and its arguments.

The code uses several features of Haskell, including:

* **Type aliases:** The `type` keyword is used to define a type alias for a list of strings. This makes it easier to work with lists of strings in the code.
* **Data types:** The `data` keyword is used to define a data type to represent a command. This data type has three constructors: `Help`, `Quit`, and `Run`.
* **Pattern matching:** The `case` keyword is used to match the value of a variable against a series of patterns. This allows the code to handle different types of commands in a concise and elegant way.
* **Monads:** The `IO` monad is used to handle input and output operations. This allows the code to interact with the user and display results.
* **Higher-order functions:** The `map` and `unwords` functions are used to transform and format lists of strings. This makes it easy to work with lists of strings in the code.

Overall, this code demonstrates the power and expressiveness of Haskell for writing complex and concise programs.
