Explanation:

1. `complexFunction`: This is the main function that takes a list of strings as input and returns the length of the longest common substring among the strings.

2. `longestCommonSubstrings`: This function finds all the longest common substrings among a list of strings. It uses `tailsOfStrings` to generate all the possible tails of the strings, and then uses `longestCommonSubstring` to find the longest common substring between each pair of tails. Finally, it filters out the substrings that are not the longest common substrings using `isLongest`.

3. `longestCommonSubstring`: This function finds the longest common substring between two strings. It uses a recursive approach to compare the characters of the strings one by one. If the characters match, it adds the character to the longest common substring and continues the recursion. If the characters don't match, it returns `Nothing`.

4. `isLongest`: This function checks if a string is the longest common substring among a list of strings. It uses `commonSubstrings` to find all the common substrings between the string and the list of strings, and then checks if the size of the set of common substrings is equal to the length of the list of strings.

5. `commonSubstrings`: This function finds all the common substrings between a string and a list of strings. It uses a fold to insert each string in the list of strings into a set of common substrings, and then returns the set.

6. `tailsOfStrings`: This function returns all the tails of a list of strings. It uses `iterate` to repeatedly apply the `tail` function to the list of strings, and then uses `nub` and `sort` to remove duplicates and sort the tails.

7. `tail`: This function computes the tail of a list, which is the list without the first element.

This code is complex and differentiated because it uses a combination of recursion, higher-order functions, and set operations to solve a challenging problem. It also uses a number of helper functions to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.
