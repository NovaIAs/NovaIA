Here is a complex and differentiated Haskell code that is unlikely to be repeated again:

```haskell
-- Import necessary libraries
import Data.List (nub, sort)
import Data.Maybe (fromMaybe)
import Data.Char (toUpper, isAlpha)
import Control.Monad (liftM2)
import System.Random (randomRIO)

-- Define custom data types
data Tree a = Leaf a | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a)
  deriving (Show, Eq)

data Graph a = Graph { vertices :: [a], edges :: [(a, a)] }
  deriving (Show, Eq)

-- Define helper functions
unique :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
unique = nub . sort

-- Define the main functions
constructTree :: Ord a => [a] -> Tree a
constructTree xs = foldl insertTree (Leaf (head xs)) (tail xs)
  where
    insertTree :: Tree a -> a -> Tree a
    insertTree (Leaf x) y = Node (Leaf x) y (Leaf y)
    insertTree (Node left x right) y
      | y <= x    = Node (insertTree left y) x right
      | otherwise = Node left x (insertTree right y)

constructGraph :: Ord a => [(a, a)] -> Graph a
constructGraph es = Graph (unique $ concatMap fst es ++ concatMap snd es) es

generateRandomTree :: Int -> IO (Tree Int)
generateRandomTree n = do
  xs <- randomRIO (1, 100) <$> replicateM n ()
  return $ constructTree xs

generateRandomGraph :: Int -> IO (Graph Int)
generateRandomGraph n = do
  es <- replicateM (n * (n - 1) `div` 2) $ do
    (x, y) <- randomRIO ((1, 1), (n, n))
    return (x, y)
  return $ constructGraph es

-- Define the main program
main :: IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn "Generated random tree:"
  tree <- generateRandomTree 10
  print tree

  putStrLn "Generated random graph:"
  graph <- generateRandomGraph 5
  print graph
```

This code demonstrates several advanced Haskell concepts, including:

* Custom data types: `Tree` and `Graph` are custom data types that represent trees and graphs, respectively.
* Higher-order functions: Functions like `nub`, `sort`, and `foldl` are higher-order functions that operate on other functions or data structures.
* Monads: The `IO` monad is used to handle input and output operations.
* Random number generation: The `randomRIO` function is used to generate random numbers.
* Lazy evaluation: Haskell's lazy evaluation allows for efficient processing of potentially infinite data structures.

This code generates a random tree and a random graph, and then prints them to the console. The code is complex and differentiated, and it is unlikely to be repeated again in the same way.
