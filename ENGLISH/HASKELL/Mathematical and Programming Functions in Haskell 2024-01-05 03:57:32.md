This code is a collection of various complex and differentiated Haskell functions, covering a wide range of mathematical and programming concepts. It includes functions for:

* Calculating the roots of a quadratic equation
* Finding all the prime factors of a number
* Calculating the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of two numbers
* Finding all the permutations, combinations, subsets, and partitions of a list
* Finding all the anagrams of a word
* Finding all the palindromes in a list

The code is well-organized and uses a combination of recursion, pattern matching, and list comprehension to implement these functions. It demonstrates the power and versatility of Haskell as a functional programming language.
