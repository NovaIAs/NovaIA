```haskell
-- This Haskell code defines a function called 'compute' that takes a list of numbers as input and performs various mathematical operations on them.

compute :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
compute xs =
  -- The 'map' function applies the given function to each element of the list.
  -- In this case, the function is 'negate', which negates each number in the list.
  map negate xs

  -- The 'foldl1' function applies a function to a list of elements,
  -- accumulating the results in a single value.
  -- In this case, the function is 'subtract', which subtracts each number from the previous one.
  -- The initial value of the accumulator is the first element of the list.
  ++ foldl1 subtract xs

  -- The 'sort' function sorts the list of numbers in ascending order.
  ++ sort xs

  -- The 'filter' function selects the elements of a list that satisfy a given predicate.
  -- In this case, the predicate is '> 0', which selects only the positive numbers in the list.
  ++ filter (> 0) xs

  -- The 'reverse' function reverses the order of the elements in the list.
  ++ reverse xs

-- This is the main function of the program, which takes a list of numbers as input and prints the result of calling the 'compute' function on that list.

main :: IO ()
main = do
  xs <- map read . words <$> getLine
  print $ compute xs
```

Explanation:

1. The 'compute' function takes a list of numbers as input and performs various mathematical operations on them.

2. The first operation is to negate each number in the list using the 'map' function.

3. The next operation is to subtract each number from the previous one using the 'foldl1' function. This results in a list of differences between consecutive numbers.

4. The list of differences is then sorted in ascending order using the 'sort' function.

5. The 'filter' function is then used to select only the positive numbers from the sorted list.

6. Finally, the 'reverse' function is used to reverse the order of the elements in the list.

7. The 'main' function of the program takes a list of numbers as input from the user and prints the result of calling the 'compute' function on that list.
