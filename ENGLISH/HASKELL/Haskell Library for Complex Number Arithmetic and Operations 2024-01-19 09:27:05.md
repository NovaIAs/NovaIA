Explanation:

1. We define a data type called `ComplexNumber` to represent complex numbers. It consists of two `Double` values, representing the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

2. We define several functions that operate on complex numbers:
   - `add` adds two complex numbers.
   - `subtract` subtracts one complex number from another.
   - `multiply` multiplies two complex numbers.
   - `divide` divides one complex number by another.
   - `magnitude` finds the magnitude (modulus) of a complex number.
   - `conjugate` finds the conjugate of a complex number.
   - `polarForm` converts a complex number to polar form (magnitude and argument).

3. We export all the functions and data types from the module using the `export` keyword, so they can be used in other modules.

This code provides a comprehensive set of functions and data types for working with complex numbers in Haskell. It demonstrates how to define custom data types, functions, and how to export them from a module.
