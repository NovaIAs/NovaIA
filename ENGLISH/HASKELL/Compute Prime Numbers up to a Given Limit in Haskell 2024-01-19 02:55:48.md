```haskell
-- A Haskell program to compute a list of prime numbers up to a given limit.

-- Import the standard mathematical functions.
import Data.List
import Data.Numbers.Primes

-- Define the main function.
main :: IO ()
main = do
  -- Read the input limit from the command line.
  putStrLn "Enter the upper limit for prime numbers: "
  input <- getLine
  let limit = read input :: Int

  -- Compute the list of prime numbers up to the limit.
  primes <- primeSieve [2..limit]

  -- Print the list of prime numbers.
  putStrLn "The prime numbers up to the limit are:"
  mapM_ print primes
```

This code is a bit more complex than the previous ones, but it is still relatively easy to understand. Let's go through it step by step:

1. We import the necessary libraries. In this case, we import the `Data.List` and `Data.Numbers.Primes` libraries. The `Data.List` library contains useful functions for working with lists, and the `Data.Numbers.Primes` library contains functions for working with prime numbers.

2. We define the `main` function. This is the entry point for the program.

3. We read the input limit from the command line using the `getLine` function. The `getLine` function returns a string, so we use the `read` function to convert the string to an integer. We then assign the integer to the `limit` variable.

4. We compute the list of prime numbers up to the limit using the `primeSieve` function from the `Data.Numbers.Primes` library. The `primeSieve` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of prime numbers that are contained in the input list.

5. We print the list of prime numbers using the `mapM_` function from the `Data.List` library. The `mapM_` function applies a function to each element of a list and prints the results. In this case, we apply the `print` function to each prime number in the list.

This code is more complex than the previous ones, but it is still relatively easy to understand. It shows how to use functions from libraries to perform complex tasks.
