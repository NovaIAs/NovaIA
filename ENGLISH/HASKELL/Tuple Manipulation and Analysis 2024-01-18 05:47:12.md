This code is a collection of functions that operate on tuples of two numbers.

The `tuples` function takes a list of numbers and returns a list of tuples, each containing two copies of the same number.

The `maximumTuple` and `minimumTuple` functions take a list of tuples and return the tuple with the maximum or minimum second element, respectively.

The `maximumTupleBy` and `minimumTupleBy` functions take a comparison function and a list of tuples and return the tuple with the maximum or minimum second element according to the comparison function.

The `maximumBy` and `minimumBy` functions take a comparison function and a list of values and return the maximum or minimum value, respectively, according to the comparison function.

The `maxBy` and `minBy` functions take a comparison function and two values and return the maximum or minimum value, respectively, according to the comparison function.

The `distance` function takes two tuples and returns the distance between them.

The `closestPair` and `furthestPair` functions take a list of tuples and return the closest and furthest pairs of tuples, respectively, according to the distance function.

The `unique` function takes a list of values and returns a list of the unique values in the list.
