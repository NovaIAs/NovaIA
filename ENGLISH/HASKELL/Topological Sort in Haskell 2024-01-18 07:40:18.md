Explanation:

* The code is a Haskell implementation of a topological sort algorithm, which sorts the nodes of a directed graph in a linear order such that for each directed edge from node `u` to node `v`, `u` comes before `v` in the ordering.
* The `topoSort` function takes a graph as input and returns a list of nodes in topological order.
* The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search on the graph, starting from each node that has not been visited yet.
* The `visit` function visits a node and adds it to the sorted list if all of its neighbors have been visited.
* The `partitionM` function partitions a list into two lists based on a predicate.
* The `isWhite` function checks if a node is white, which means that it has not been visited yet.
* The main function creates a directed graph and prints the topological sorting of the graph.
