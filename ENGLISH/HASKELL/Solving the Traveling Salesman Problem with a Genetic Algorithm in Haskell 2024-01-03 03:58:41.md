Certainly! Here's a complex and differentiated Haskell code that implements a genetic algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP). The TSP is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest route that visits a set of cities and returns to the starting city.

```haskell
import System.Random
import Data.List

type City = (Int, Int)
type Path = [City]
type Fitness = Double

-- Define the list of cities
cities :: [City]
cities = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8), (9, 10)]

-- Generate a random population of paths
generatePopulation :: Int -> [Path]
generatePopulation size = replicate size (randomPath cities)

-- Create a random path by shuffling the list of cities
randomPath :: [City] -> Path
randomPath cs = let shuffled = shuffle cs
                in shuffled ++ [head shuffled]

-- Shuffle a list randomly using Fisher-Yates algorithm
shuffle :: [a] -> [a]
shuffle xs = doShuffle xs (length xs - 1)
  where
    doShuffle [] _ = []
    doShuffle xs 0 = xs
    doShuffle xs n = let (ys, zs) = splitAt n xs
                         (zs', x:ys') = splitAt n zs
                     in ys ++ [x] ++ doShuffle (ys' ++ zs') (n - 1)

-- Calculate the total distance of a path
calculateDistance :: Path -> Double
calculateDistance path = sum $ zipWith distance path (tail path)
  where
    distance (x1, y1) (x2, y2) = sqrt $ fromIntegral ((x2 - x1) ^ 2 + (y2 - y1) ^ 2)

-- Calculate the fitness of a path (inverse of distance)
calculateFitness :: Path -> Fitness
calculateFitness path = 1 / calculateDistance path

-- Select parents using tournament selection
selectParents :: [Path] -> IO (Path, Path)
selectParents population = do
  let randomIndexes = replicateM 2 $ randomRIO (0, length population - 1)
  parents <- mapM (population !!) randomIndexes
  return (maximumBy (compare `on` calculateFitness) parents, maximumBy (compare `on` calculateFitness) parents)

-- Crossover two paths to produce offspring
crossover :: Path -> Path -> IO Path
crossover path1 path2 = do
  let size = length path1
  point <- randomRIO (1, size - 2)
  let (start, end) = if point < size `div` 2 then (point, size) else (0, point)
  let offspring = take start path1 ++ drop start (take end path2) ++ drop end path1
  return $ if null $ nub offspring then path1 else offspring

-- Mutate a path by swapping two cities
mutate :: Path -> IO Path
mutate path = do
  let size = length path
  point1 <- randomRIO (0, size - 1)
  point2 <- randomRIO (0, size - 1)
  let (start, end) = if point1 < point2 then (point1, point2) else (point2, point1)
  let mutated = take start path ++ [path !! end] ++ drop (start + 1) (take end path) ++ [path !! start] ++ drop (end + 1) path
  return mutated

-- Generate the next generation using elitism, crossover, and mutation
generateNextGeneration :: [Path] -> IO [Path]
generateNextGeneration population = do
  let eliteSize = length population `div` 10
  let elites = take eliteSize $ reverse $ sortBy (compare `on` calculateFitness) population
  parents <- replicateM (length population - eliteSize) (selectParents population)
  offspring <- mapM (uncurry crossover) parents
  mutated <- mapM mutate offspring
  return $ elites ++ mutated

-- Find the best path after a number of generations
findBestPath :: Int -> [Path] -> IO Path
findBestPath 0 population = return $ maximumBy (compare `on` calculateFitness) population
findBestPath n population = do
  nextGen <- generateNextGeneration population
  findBestPath (n - 1) nextGen

-- Main function
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let populationSize = 100
  let generations = 100
  initialPopulation <- generatePopulation populationSize
  bestPath <- findBestPath generations initialPopulation
  putStrLn $ "Best path: " ++ show bestPath
  putStrLn $ "Distance: " ++ show (calculateDistance bestPath)
```

Explanation:
- The code defines the basic types `City`, `Path`, and `Fitness` to represent a city coordinate, a path of cities, and the fitness value of a path, respectively.
- The list of cities is defined in the `cities` variable.
- The `generatePopulation` function generates a random population of paths by repeatedly calling the `randomPath` function.
- The `randomPath` function shuffles the list of cities using the Fisher-Yates algorithm and returns a path.
- The `shuffle` function shuffles a list randomly.
- The `calculateDistance` function calculates the total distance of a path by summing the distances between consecutive cities.
- The `calculateFitness` function calculates the fitness value of a path as the inverse of its distance.
- The `selectParents` function uses tournament selection to select two parents from the population with the highest fitness values.
- The `crossover` function performs crossover between two parent paths to produce an offspring path.
- The `mutate` function mutates a path by swapping two cities.
- The `generateNextGeneration` function generates the next generation of paths by applying elitism, crossover, and mutation.
- The `findBestPath` function recursively generates the next generations until the specified number of generations is reached, returning the path with the highest fitness value.
- The `main` function sets the population size and number of generations, generates the initial population, and finds the best path.
- Finally, the best path and its distance are printed to the console.

This code implements a solution to the TSP using a genetic algorithm, which involves generating an initial population of paths, selecting parents based on their fitness values, performing crossover and mutation operations, and generating successive generations. The algorithm aims to find the path with the shortest distance, representing the optimal solution to the TSP.
