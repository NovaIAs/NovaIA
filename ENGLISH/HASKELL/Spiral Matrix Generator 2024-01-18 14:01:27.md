Explanation:

1. The "spiralMatrix" function takes an integer n as input and returns a two-dimensional list of integers representing a spiral matrix of size n x n.

2. The helper function "spiral" takes a list of lists, a starting row index, a starting column index, a row count, and a column count as input and returns a list of lists representing the spiral matrix.

3. The "spiral" function first checks if the row count and column count are less than or equal to 0. If they are, it means that the spiral matrix has been completely constructed, so it returns the current matrix.

4. If the row count and column count are greater than 0, the "spiral" function adds the top row of the spiral to the matrix. It then recursively calls itself to add the right column, bottom row, and left column of the spiral.

5. The "printMatrix" function takes a two-dimensional list of integers as input and prints it to the console.

6. The user is prompted to enter the size of the spiral matrix.

7. The "spiralMatrix" function is called with the user's input to generate the spiral matrix.

8. The "printMatrix" function is called to print the spiral matrix to the console.
