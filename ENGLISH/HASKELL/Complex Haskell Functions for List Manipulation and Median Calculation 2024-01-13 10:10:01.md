This code defines two complex functions in Haskell. The first function, `complexFunction`, takes a list of integers and returns a list of lists of integers, where each sublist contains all the integers from the original list that have the same value. The sublists are sorted by their lengths in descending order, and the longest sublist is returned.

The second function, `anotherComplexFunction`, takes a list of lists of integers and returns an integer. The function concatenates all the sublists in the input list into a single list, sorts the list in ascending order, and finds the median of the sorted list. The median is the middle value of the list, or the average of the two middle values if the list has an even number of elements.

The code uses several Haskell features, including list comprehensions, lambda expressions, and higher-order functions. The code is also heavily commented to make it easier to understand.
