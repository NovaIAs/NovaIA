Explanation:

1. **Deck Struct**: We define a `Deck` struct to represent a deck of cards. It contains a slice of integers (`cards`) to represent the cards in the deck.

2. **NewDeck Function**: The `NewDeck` function creates a new deck of 52 cards by initializing the `cards` slice with values from 0 to 51.

3. **Shuffle Method**: The `Shuffle` method shuffles the deck of cards using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm. It iterates through the cards, randomly selecting another card to swap with the current card.

4. **Deal Method**: The `Deal` method deals a hand of cards from the deck. It checks if there are enough cards in the deck to deal the desired hand size. If there are, it removes the first `handSize` cards from the deck and returns them as a slice of integers.

5. **Print Method**: The `Print` method prints the cards in the deck. It iterates through the cards and prints each card.

6. **Main Function**: In the `main` function, we create a new deck, shuffle it, deal a hand of 5 cards, and print the hand and remaining cards in the deck.
