This code is a simulation of a card game. It creates a deck of cards, shuffles the deck, and then deals a hand of cards to each player. The players' hands are then printed.

The code uses a number of different data structures and functions to implement the game. The `Deck` struct represents the deck of cards. The `Shuffle` method shuffles the deck. The `Deal` method deals a hand of cards from the deck. The `Print` method prints the cards in the deck.

The `Hand` struct represents a hand of cards. The `Print` method prints the cards in the hand.

The `Player` struct represents a player. The `GiveHand` method gives the player a hand of cards. The `Print` method prints the player's name and hand.

The `main` function creates a new deck of cards, shuffles the deck, and then deals a hand of cards to each player. The players' hands are then printed.
