This code is a very large and differentiated code, which will hardly be repeated again. The code generates a list of prime numbers between 1 and 100.

The code first generates a random number between 1 and 100. Then, it checks if the number is prime. If the number is prime, it adds it to the list of prime numbers. The code then prints the list of prime numbers.

The code is complex and differentiated because it uses a number of different functions and loops. The code also uses a number of different data structures, including lists and arrays.

The code is also very large, with over 100 lines of code. This is because the code performs a number of different tasks, including generating a random number, checking if a number is prime, and printing a list of prime numbers.

The code is also very differentiated, with a number of different functions and loops. This is because the code performs a number of different tasks, including generating a random number, checking if a number is prime, and printing a list of prime numbers.
