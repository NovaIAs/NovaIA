Certainly! Below is a complex and unique code written in Go. This code implements a concurrent web scraper that fetches data from multiple websites concurrently and saves it to a database.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "sync"
    "time"
    "io/ioutil"
    "database/sql"
    _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
)

// Website represents a website to scrape
type Website struct {
    URL  string
    Name string
}

// Result represents the scraped data
type Result struct {
    WebsiteName string
    Content     string
}

func main() {
    // Define the websites to scrape
    websites := []Website{
        {URL: "https://example1.com", Name: "Example 1"},
        {URL: "https://example2.com", Name: "Example 2"},
        {URL: "https://example3.com", Name: "Example 3"},
    }

    // Create a wait group to keep track of goroutines
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    // Create a channel to receive the results
    results := make(chan Result)

    // Create a database connection
    db, err := sql.Open("mysql", "username:password@tcp(localhost:3306)/database")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error opening database connection:", err)
        return
    }
    defer db.Close()

    // Create a goroutine for each website to scrape concurrently
    for _, website := range websites {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func(website Website) {
            defer wg.Done()

            // Make an HTTP GET request to the website
            resp, err := http.Get(website.URL)
            if err != nil {
                fmt.Println("Error fetching", website.URL, ":", err)
                return
            }
            defer resp.Body.Close()

            // Read the response body
            body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
            if err != nil {
                fmt.Println("Error reading response body of", website.URL, ":", err)
                return
            }

            // Save the result to the database
            _, err = db.Exec("INSERT INTO scraped_data (website_name, content) VALUES (?, ?)",
                website.Name, string(body))
            if err != nil {
                fmt.Println("Error saving result to database:", err)
                return
            }

            // Send the result to the channel
            results <- Result{WebsiteName: website.Name, Content: string(body)}
        }(website)
    }

    // Wait for all goroutines to finish
    go func() {
        wg.Wait()
        close(results)
    }()

    // Process the results received from the channel
    for result := range results {
        fmt.Println("Scraped", result.WebsiteName)
        // Process the scraped data as per your requirements
    }

    fmt.Println("Scraping completed!")
}
```

Explanation:
This code demonstrates the use of goroutines and channels in Go to perform concurrent web scraping and database operations. 

First, we define the `Website` struct to hold the URL and name of each website to scrape. The `Result` struct holds the scraped data along with the website name.

In the `main()` function, we create a list of websites to scrape and initialize a wait group to keep track of goroutines. We also create a channel called `results` to receive the scraped data.

Next, we establish a database connection using the `database/sql` package and defer its closure at the end of the function.

We then use a loop to create a goroutine for each website. Each goroutine fetches the website's content using an HTTP GET request and saves it to the database. The scraped data is also sent to the `results` channel.

After creating all the goroutines, we start another goroutine to wait until all the goroutines are finished and close the `results` channel.

Finally, we process the results received from the `results` channel, perform any required operations on the scraped data, and print a completion message.

Please note that you need to replace `"username:password@tcp(localhost:3306)/database"` with your actual MySQL database connection details. Additionally, make sure to import the necessary packages and have MySQL driver installed (`go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`) before running this code.
