}
```

This code is a simple web server that generates random numbers. It uses the `http` package to create a new HTTP server, and the `fmt` package to write the random number to the response. The `rand` package is used to generate the random number.

The `main` function is the entry point for the program. It creates a new HTTP server, and then starts the server.

The `http.HandleFunc` function is used to register a handler function for the root URL ("/"). When a client sends a request to the root URL, the handler function will be called.

The handler function gets the current time using the `time.Now()` function. It then generates a random number using the `rand.Intn()` function. The `rand.Seed()` function is used to seed the random number generator with the current time. This ensures that the random numbers are different each time the server is started.

Finally, the handler function writes the random number to the response using the `fmt.Fprintf()` function.

The `log.Fatal()` function is used to log an error and then exit the program. In this case, it is used to log an error if the server fails to start.

This code is complex because it uses multiple packages and functions to generate a random number and write it to a response. It also uses a goroutine to handle each client request. This makes the code more efficient and scalable.
