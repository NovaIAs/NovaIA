This code is a complete GraphQL server written in Go. It uses the `gqlgen` library to generate the GraphQL schema and resolvers. The server is started on port 8080 and serves the GraphQL endpoint at `/graphql` and the playground endpoint at `/`. The server also uses CORS to allow requests from any origin.

The code is well-commented and easy to understand. It is a good example of how to use `gqlgen` to create a GraphQL server in Go.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The `package main` line indicates that this is the main Go program.
* The `import` lines import the necessary libraries.
* The `const` lines define the database connection parameters.
* The `db` variable is used to store the database connection.
* The `srv` variable is used to store the GraphQL server.
* The `httpServer` variable is used to store the HTTP server.
* The `httpServerAddr` variable stores the address on which the HTTP server will listen.
* The `quit` channel is used to signal the HTTP server to shut down.
* The `signal.Notify` line registers the SIGINT and SIGTERM signals with the `quit` channel.
* The `<-quit` line waits for a signal to be sent to the `quit` channel.
* The `ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)` line creates a context with a timeout of 5 seconds.
* The `httpServer.Shutdown(ctx)` line shuts down the HTTP server.
* The `db.Close()` line closes the database connection.
