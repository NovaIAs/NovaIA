This code is a complex and differentiated Go program that implements a distributed URL shortener.
The program uses a simple in-memory database to store the URLs, but in a real application, we would use a distributed database.
The program also uses a lock to protect the data in the database, but in a real application, we would use a distributed lock.
The program is also designed to handle a burst of requests, using a worker pool to send the URLs to the server.

Here is an explanation of the code:

* The `main` function creates a new router using the `mux` library and then creates a server for each shard.
The server is implemented by the `server` struct, which has a `handle` method that saves a URL in a shard.
* The `get` function gets a URL from a shard, and the `delete` function deletes a URL from a shard.
* The `run` function sends a burst of requests to the server using a worker pool.

The program can be run by using the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Once the program is running, you can use the following commands to interact with the URL shortener:

* To save a URL, use the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST -d "url=http://example.com/1" http://localhost:8080/shard/0
```

* To get a URL, use the following command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/shard/0?url=http://example.com/1
```

* To delete a URL, use the following command:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/shard/0?url=http://example.com/1
```

The program can also be used to test the performance of the URL shortener.
To do this, you can use a tool like `wrk` to send a large number of requests to the server.
For example, the following command sends 100000 requests to the server:

```bash
wrk -t100 -c1000 http://localhost:8080/shard/0
```

The output of the `wrk` command will show you the performance of the URL shortener.
