            // Increment the counter protected by an atomic variable
            for j := 0; j < numIterations; j++ {
                atomic.AddInt64(&atomicCounter, 1)
            }

            // Signal that the goroutine is done
            wg.Done()
        }()
    }

    // Wait for all goroutines to finish
    wg.Wait()

    fmt.Printf("Atomic counter: %d\n", atomicCounter)
}
```

This code demonstrates how to use mutexes and atomic variables to protect shared state in Go.

The `counter` variable is protected by a mutex, which ensures that only one goroutine can access it at a time. This prevents data corruption that can occur when multiple goroutines try to modify the same variable concurrently.

The `atomicCounter` variable is protected by an atomic variable, which is a special type of variable that can be safely accessed by multiple goroutines without the need for a mutex. Atomic variables are often used to implement lock-free data structures, such as counters and queues.

The code creates 1000 goroutines, each of which increments the counters 1000000 times. The `wg.Wait()` call at the end of the `main()` function ensures that all goroutines have finished before the program prints the final values of the counters.

The output of the program should be:

```
Mutex counter: 1000000000
Atomic counter: 1000000000
```

This shows that both the mutex and atomic variable successfully protected the shared state from data corruption.
