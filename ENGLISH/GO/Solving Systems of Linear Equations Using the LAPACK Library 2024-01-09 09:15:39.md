This code solves a system of linear equations using the LAPACK library. The system of equations is defined by the matrix A and the vector b. The solution to the system of equations is stored in the vector x.

The code first defines the matrix A and the vector b. Then, it converts the matrix A and the vector b to LAPACK format. Next, it solves the system of equations using LAPACK. After that, it checks if the system of equations was solved successfully. If the system of equations was solved successfully, the code prints the solution to the system of equations.

The code then calculates the residual of the system of equations. The residual is the difference between the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the system of equations. The code then prints the residual of the system of equations.

Next, the code calculates the condition number of the matrix A. The condition number of a matrix is a measure of how sensitive the solution to a system of linear equations is to changes in the matrix A. The code then prints the condition number of the matrix A.

Finally, the code calculates the time it takes to solve the system of equations. The code does this by running the system of equations 10,000 times and measuring the time it takes to solve the system of equations each time. The code then prints the average time it takes to solve the system of equations.
