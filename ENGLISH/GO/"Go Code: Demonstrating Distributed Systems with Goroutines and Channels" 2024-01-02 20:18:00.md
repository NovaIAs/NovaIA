Of course! Here's a complex Go code that demonstrates a distributed system using a combination of goroutines, channels, and concurrency. The code simulates a distributed network of nodes that communicate with each other to perform a specific task.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

type Node struct {
	ID       int
	Hostname string
}

type Message struct {
	Sender  int
	Content string
}

func main() {
	numNodes := 10
	nodes := make([]*Node, numNodes)
	messages := make(chan Message)
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	// Create nodes
	for i := 0; i < numNodes; i++ {
		nodes[i] = &Node{ID: i, Hostname: fmt.Sprintf("node%d", i)}
	}

	// Start nodes
	for _, node := range nodes {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func(n *Node) {
			defer wg.Done()
			nodeProcess(n, messages)
		}(node)
	}

	// Send messages
	for i := 0; i < numNodes; i++ {
		content := fmt.Sprintf("Hello from node %d", i)
		messages <- Message{Sender: i, Content: content}
	}

	close(messages)

	wg.Wait()
}

func nodeProcess(node *Node, messages <-chan Message) {
	for message := range messages {
		fmt.Printf("[%s] Received message from node %d: %s\n", node.Hostname, message.Sender, message.Content)
		time.Sleep(time.Second) // Simulate some processing time
	}
}
```

In this code, we define a `Node` struct that represents a node in the distributed network, containing an ID and a hostname. We also define a `Message` struct that represents a message sent between nodes, containing the sender's ID and the content of the message.

The `main` function initializes the required variables, including the number of nodes (`numNodes`), an array of `Node` pointers (`nodes`), and a channel of `Message` structs (`messages`) for inter-node communication. It then creates the desired number of nodes and starts goroutines to execute the `nodeProcess` function for each node.

The `nodeProcess` function is responsible for processing incoming messages from the `messages` channel for a specific node. It prints the received message, simulates some processing time with `time.Sleep`, and repeats this process until the channel is closed.

In the `main` function, after starting the nodes, we iterate over each node and send a message to the `messages` channel for each node. Finally, we close the `messages` channel and wait for all goroutines to finish using a `sync.WaitGroup` to synchronize the completion of the program.

This code demonstrates the power of Go's goroutines and channels to build concurrent, distributed systems. Each node is capable of processing incoming messages concurrently, and the program as a whole can handle multiple nodes communicating with each other simultaneously.
