This code implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which is used to find the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. The algorithm works by iteratively updating the distance matrix, which stores the shortest distances between all pairs of vertices, until the shortest paths are found.

The code starts by initializing the distance matrix to the values in the input graph. Then, it iterates over all vertices as an intermediate vertex, and for each intermediate vertex, it iterates over all source vertices and destination vertices. If the path through the intermediate vertex is shorter than the current shortest path, the distance matrix is updated.

After all vertices have been considered as intermediate vertices, the distance matrix will contain the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in the graph. The code then prints the distance matrix, which shows the shortest distance between each pair of vertices.

This code is complex and differentiated because it implements a well-known algorithm in a clear and concise way. It also uses a variety of programming techniques, such as nested loops and conditional statements, to solve a complex problem.
