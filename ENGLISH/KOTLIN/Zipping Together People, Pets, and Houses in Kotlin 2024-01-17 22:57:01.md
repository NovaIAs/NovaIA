    // Use the `map` function to create a new list of strings, each of which contains the name of the person, the name of their pet, and the address of their house

    val results = combinedLists.map { (person, pet, house) -> "${person.name} has a ${pet.name} named ${pet.species} and lives at ${house.address}." }

This code first defines the data classes for the objects in the system. These data classes are used to represent people, pets, and houses. The `Person` data class has two properties: `name` and `age`. The `Pet` data class has three properties: `name`, `species`, and `age`. The `House` data class has three properties: `address`, `numBedrooms`, and `numBathrooms`.

The `main` function is the starting point of the program. It first creates a list of people, a list of pets, and a list of houses. Then, it uses the `zip` function to combine these lists into a single list of tuples. Each tuple contains a person, a pet, and a house.

The `map` function is then used to create a new list of strings, each of which contains the name of the person, the name of their pet, and the address of their house. Finally, the `forEach` function is used to print the results to the console.

This code is complex and differentiated because it uses a variety of language features, including data classes, lambda expressions, and higher-order functions. It also uses the `zip` and `map` functions to combine and transform data in a concise and efficient manner.
