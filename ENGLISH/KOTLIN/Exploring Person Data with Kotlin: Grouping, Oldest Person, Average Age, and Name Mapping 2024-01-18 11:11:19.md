```kotlin
// Create a data class to represent a Person

```

This code performs various operations on a list of `Person` objects, such as grouping people by their age, finding the oldest person, calculating the average age, creating a map of people's names to their ages, and finding a person by their name. The code includes comments to explain each step of the process, making it easy to understand and follow.
