This code is a Java program that reads a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an array of integers, sorts the array, and then calculates the most frequent element in the array. The program prints the most frequent element and its frequency for each test case.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The `main` function is the entry point of the program.
* The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the console.
* The `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer from the console.
* The `for` loop is used to loop through the test cases.
* The `sort()` method is used to sort the array in ascending order.
* The `PriorityQueue` class is used to store the elements of the array.
* The `add()` method is used to add an element to the priority queue.
* The `poll()` method is used to remove and return the smallest element from the priority queue.
* The `HashMap` class is used to store the frequency of each element in the array.
* The `getOrDefault()` method is used to get the value of a key from the hash map. If the key does not exist, the default value is returned.
* The `while` loop is used to iterate through the priority queue and calculate the frequency of each element in the array.
* The `println()` method is used to print the most frequent element and its frequency.
