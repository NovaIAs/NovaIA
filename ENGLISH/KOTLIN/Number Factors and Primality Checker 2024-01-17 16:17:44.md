This code is a program that takes a number as input and prints its factors and whether it is prime or not.

The code first creates a Scanner object to read input from the console. Then, it prompts the user to enter a number and reads the number from the console.

Next, the code creates a mutable list of factors for the number. It then iterates over the numbers from 1 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by each number. If it is, it adds the number and the quotient of the number divided by the number to the list of factors.

After the loop, the code prints the list of factors.

Finally, the code checks if the number is prime by checking if the list of factors has only two elements (1 and the number itself). If it does, the number is prime. Otherwise, it is not prime. The code then prints whether the number is prime or not.
