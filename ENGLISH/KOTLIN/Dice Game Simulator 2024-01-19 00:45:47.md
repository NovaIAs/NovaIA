This code simulates a simple dice game for multiple players. It prompts the user to enter the number of players, then prompts each player to enter their name. The code then initializes an ArrayList to store the names of the players and a HashMap to store the scores of the players.

The game is played for 10 rounds. In each round, a random number is generated for each player, and their score is updated accordingly. The scores of the players are displayed after each round.

After the 10 rounds are complete, the winner of the game is determined by finding the player with the highest score. The winner's name and score are displayed at the end of the game.
