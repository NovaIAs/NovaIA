```kotlin
// Define a sealed class to represent different types of events
sealed class Event {
    // An event representing the user clicking a button
    object ButtonClick : Event()

    // An event representing the user entering text into a field
    data class TextEntered(val text: String) : Event()

    // An event representing the user selecting an item from a list
    data class ItemSelected(val item: Int) : Event()
}

// Define a class to represent the state of the application
data class State(val count: Int)

// Define a reducer function to update the state based on an event
fun reducer(state: State, event: Event): State {
    when (event) {
        // If the event is a button click, increment the count
        is Event.ButtonClick -> return State(state.count + 1)

        // If the event is text entered, store the text in the state
        is Event.TextEntered -> return State(state.count + event.text.length)

        // If the event is an item selected, store the selected item in the state
        is Event.ItemSelected -> return State(state.count + event.item)
    }
}

// Define a function to dispatch events to the reducer
fun dispatch(event: Event) {
    // Get the current state from the store
    val state = store.getState()

    // Update the state using the reducer
    val newState = reducer(state, event)

    // Set the new state in the store
    store.setState(newState)
}

// Define a store to hold the state of the application
object store {
    private var state: State = State(0)

    fun getState(): State {
        return state
    }

    fun setState(newState: State) {
        state = newState
    }
}

fun main() {
    // Dispatch a button click event
    dispatch(Event.ButtonClick)

    // Get the current state from the store
    val state = store.getState()

    // Print the current count to the console
    println("The current count is ${state.count}")

    // Dispatch an event representing the user entering text into a field
    dispatch(Event.TextEntered("Hello, world!"))

    // Get the current state from the store again
    val newState = store.getState()

    // Print the new count to the console
    println("The new count is ${newState.count}")
}
```

This code demonstrates the use of a sealed class to represent different types of events, a data class to represent the state of the application, a reducer function to update the state based on an event, a function to dispatch events to the reducer, and a store to hold the state of the application. It also includes a main function that dispatches a button click event and an event representing the user entering text into a field, and prints the current count to the console.

This code is complex and differentiated because it uses a number of different programming concepts, including sealed classes, data classes, reducer functions, event dispatchers, and stores. It also demonstrates how to use these concepts to build a simple event-driven application in Kotlin.
