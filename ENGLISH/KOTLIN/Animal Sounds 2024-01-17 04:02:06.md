Explanation:

1. We define an abstract class called `Animal` with a protected property called `name`. This class serves as a base class for other animal classes.

2. We define three classes called `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Fish` that extend the `Animal` class. Each class represents a specific type of animal.

3. Each animal class defines a method that represents the sound made by that animal. For example, `Dog` has a `bark()` method, `Cat` has a `meow()` method, and `Fish` has a `swim()` method.

4. We define a function called `makeAnimalSounds()` that takes a list of animals as an argument. This function iterates over the list of animals and calls the appropriate method for each animal.

5. We create a list of animals containing instances of `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Fish`.

6. We call the `makeAnimalSounds()` function with the list of animals to make each animal make its sound.
