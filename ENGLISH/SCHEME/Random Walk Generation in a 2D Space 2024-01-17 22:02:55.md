Explanation:

1. The `random-walk` procedure takes a size as an argument, which represents the desired length of the random walk.

2. Inside the `random-walk` procedure, a helper function named `helper` is defined. This helper function is responsible for recursively generating the random walk.

3. The `helper` function takes the current random walk as an argument and returns the extended random walk with an additional step.

4. Inside the `helper` function, a new random direction is generated using the `new-direction` function.

5. The `new-direction` function generates a random direction for the random walk by selecting one of the four possible directions: up, down, left, or right.

6. The new direction is then added to the current random walk to extend it.

7. The helper function is called recursively with the extended random walk, and this process continues until the desired size of the random walk is reached.

8. Finally, the `random-walk` procedure returns the complete random walk generated by the `helper` function.

9. In the example at the end of the code, the `random-walk` procedure is called with a size of 10, and the result is displayed. This will generate and display a random walk of length 10 in a 2D space.
