Explanations:

- The `prime?` function checks whether a given number is prime or not.
- The `goldbach-conjecture-pair` function takes a number as input and tries to find a pair of prime numbers that add up to that number.
- The `loop` function is a recursive function that tries to find a pair of prime numbers that add up to the given number `n`.
- The `p` variable is the current prime number being checked.
- The `if` statement checks if `p` is prime and if the difference between `n` and `p` is also prime.
- If both conditions are true, then the function returns the pair of prime numbers `p` and `(- n p)`.
- If either condition is false, then the function calls itself recursively with the updated values of `n` and `p`.
- The `for-each` function calls the `goldbach-conjecture-pair` function for each number in the range 5 to 100 and prints the results.
