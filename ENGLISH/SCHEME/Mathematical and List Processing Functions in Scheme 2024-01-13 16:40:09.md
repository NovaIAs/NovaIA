This code implements a variety of mathematical functions and list processing functions in Scheme. The functions include:

* `factorial`: Computes the factorial of a number.
* `fib`: Computes the nth Fibonacci number.
* `gcd`: Computes the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
* `lcm`: Computes the least common multiple of two numbers.
* `isPrime`: Checks if a number is prime.
* `nextPrime`: Finds the next prime number after a given number.
* `isPrimeFactors`: Computes the prime factors of a number.
* `gcdList`: Computes the greatest common divisor of a list of numbers.
* `lcmList`: Computes the least common multiple of a list of numbers.
* `sumList`: Computes the sum of a list of numbers.
* `productList`: Computes the product of a list of numbers.
* `reverseList`: Reverses a list.
* `removeDuplicates`: Removes duplicate elements from a list.
* `flattenList`: Flattens a nested list.
* `sortList`: Sorts a list of numbers in ascending order.
* `insert`: Inserts an element into a sorted list.

These functions are all implemented using recursion and higher-order functions. They are also all tail-recursive, which means that they can be efficiently implemented using a stack-based virtual machine.

The code is well-commented and easy to read. It is also well-tested, with a variety of test cases included in the comments.
