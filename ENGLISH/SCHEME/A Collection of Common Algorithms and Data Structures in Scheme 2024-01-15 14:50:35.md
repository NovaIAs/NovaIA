This code is a collection of some of the most common algorithms and data structures in computer science, implemented in Scheme. It includes functions for finding the factorial of a number, calculating the Fibonacci sequence, finding the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of two numbers, checking if a number is prime, finding the prime factors of a number, checking if a string is a palindrome, reversing a string, sorting a list of numbers using quicksort, merge sort, and heap sort, and implementing a heap data structure.

The code is well-commented and easy to follow, making it a great resource for anyone who wants to learn more about these algorithms and data structures.
