This code is a collection of statistical functions that can be used to analyze a list of numbers. The functions include:

* `sum`: This function takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of its elements.
* `average`: This function takes a list of numbers and returns the average of its elements.
* `maximum`: This function takes a list of numbers and returns the maximum of its elements.
* `minimum`: This function takes a list of numbers and returns the minimum of its elements.
* `median`: This function takes a list of numbers and returns the median of its elements.
* `mode`: This function takes a list of numbers and returns the mode of its elements.
* `range`: This function takes a list of numbers and returns the range of its elements.
* `variance`: This function takes a list of numbers and returns the variance of its elements.
* `standard-deviation`: This function takes a list of numbers and returns the standard deviation of its elements.
* `correlation-coefficient`: This function takes two lists of numbers and returns the correlation coefficient between the two variables.

These functions can be used to analyze data in a variety of ways. For example, you could use them to find the average age of a group of people, or to calculate the correlation coefficient between two variables.

To use these functions, you simply need to pass them a list of numbers as an argument. The functions will then return the result of the calculation.

For example, the following code calculates the average age of a group of people:

```scheme
(define people '(20 30 40 50 60))
(display (average people))
```

This code will print the following output:

```
40
```

This means that the average age of the group of people is 40 years old.
