Certainly! Here's a complex and differentiated code in Scheme that implements a genetic algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the starting city.

```scheme
;; Define the list of cities and their coordinates
(define cities
  '((A 0 0)
    (B 1 1)
    (C 2 2)
    (D 3 3)
    (E 4 4)))

;; Define the distance function between two cities
(define (distance city1 city2)
  (let* ((x1 (cadr city1))
         (y1 (caddr city1))
         (x2 (cadr city2))
         (y2 (caddr city2)))
    (sqrt (+ (expt (- x2 x1) 2)
             (expt (- y2 y1) 2)))))

;; Define a function to calculate the total distance of a route
(define (total-distance route)
  (let loop ((cities route) (total 0))
    (if (null? (cdr cities))
        total
        (loop (cdr cities) 
              (+ total (distance (car cities) (cadr cities)))))))

;; Define a function to generate a random permutation of cities
(define (random-permutation cities)
  (let ((perm (shuffle cities)))
    (cons (car cities) perm)))

;; Define a function to initialize a population of random routes
(define (initialize-population cities size)
  (build-list size (lambda (_) (random-permutation cities))))

;; Define a function to mutate a route
(define (mutate route)
  (let* ((size (length route))
         (i (random size))
         (j (random size))
         (perm (shuffle route)))
    (if (and (< i j) (< (+ j 1) size))
        (append (take route i)
                (list (list-ref perm i) (list-ref perm j))
                (drop route (+ j 1)))
        route)))

;; Define a function to select parents for crossover
(define (select-parents population)
  (let* ((size (length population))
         (i (random size))
         (j (random size)))
    (list (list-ref population i)
          (list-ref population j))))

;; Define a function to perform crossover
(define (crossover parent1 parent2)
  (let* ((size (length parent1))
         (i (random size))
         (j (random size)))
    (if (< i j)
        (let* ((slice (take parent1 (- j i)))
               (child1 (append (drop parent2 j) slice (drop parent2 j)))
               (child2 (append (drop parent1 j) slice (drop parent1 j))))
          (list child1 child2))
        (let* ((slice (take parent1 (- i j)))
               (child1 (append (drop parent2 i) slice (drop parent2 i)))
               (child2 (append (drop parent1 i) slice (drop parent1 i))))
          (list child1 child2)))))

;; Define a function to perform elitism selection
(define (elitism population fittest)
  (let* ((size (length population))
         (i (random size)))
    (list (list-ref population i) fittest)))

;; Define the genetic algorithm function
(define (genetic-algorithm cities population-size generations)
  (define (ga-loop population gen)
    (let* ((fittest (min-by total-distance population)))
      (if (= gen generations)
          fittest
          (ga-loop (elitism (map mutate population) fittest)
                   (+ gen 1)))))
  (ga-loop (initialize-population cities population-size) 0))

;; Run the genetic algorithm with a population size of 100 and 100 generations
(genetic-algorithm cities 100 100)
```

Explanation:

1. First, we define the list of cities, where each city is represented by a list containing its name and coordinates.

2. Then, we define the `distance` function that calculates the Euclidean distance between two cities using their coordinates.

3. The `total-distance` function takes a route (a list of cities) and calculates the total distance of the route by summing the distances between consecutive cities.

4. Next, the `random-permutation` function takes a list of cities and returns a random permutation of them.

5. The `initialize-population` function generates a population of random routes by calling `random-permutation` multiple times.

6. The `mutate` function randomly selects two positions in a route and swaps the cities at those positions.

7. The `select-parents` function randomly selects two parents from the population.

8. The `crossover` function performs crossover between two parents, creating two children. It randomly selects a slice from one parent and fills the rest of the child with cities from the other parent.

9. The `elitism` function selects one parent from the population randomly and combines it with the fittest individual.

10. Finally, the `genetic-algorithm` function initializes a population and performs the genetic algorithm loop for a given number of generations, returning the fittest individual found.

The code uses various techniques from functional programming, such as recursion, higher-order functions (`min-by`, `shuffle`, `build-list`), and list manipulation functions (`append`, `take`, `drop`). It demonstrates how to implement a genetic algorithm to solve a complex optimization problem like the Travelling Salesman Problem.
