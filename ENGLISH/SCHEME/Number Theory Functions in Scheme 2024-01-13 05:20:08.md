This code implements a variety of number theory functions in Scheme. The functions include:

* **gcd**: Calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
* **lcm**: Calculates the least common multiple of two numbers.
* **coprime?**: Checks if two numbers are coprime (have no common factors other than 1).
* **prime?**: Checks if a number is prime.
* **factors**: Returns the prime factors of a number.
* **all-factors**: Returns all the factors of a number, including 1 and the number itself.
* **num-divisors**: Returns the number of divisors of a number.
* **sum-divisors**: Returns the sum of the divisors of a number.
* **totient**: Calculates the totient of a number (the number of positive integers less than or equal to the number that are coprime to it).
* **mobius**: Implements the Mobius function, which is used in number theory to study the distribution of prime numbers.
* **euler-phi**: Calculates the Euler phi function of a number (the number of positive integers less than or equal to the number that are coprime to it).
* **legendre**: Implements the Legendre symbol, which is used in number theory to study quadratic reciprocity.
* **jacobi**: Implements the Jacobi symbol, which is a generalization of the Legendre symbol.
* **kronecker**: Implements the Kronecker symbol, which is a generalization of the Jacobi symbol.

These functions are all implemented in a modular and reusable way, and they can be used to solve a variety of number theory problems. For example, the following code uses the **factors** function to find the prime factors of 100:

```scheme
(factors 100)
```

```
'(2 2 5 5)
```

The following code uses the **totient** function to find the totient of 100:

```scheme
(totient 100)
```

```
40
```

The following code uses the **mobius** function to calculate the Mobius function for the first 100 numbers:

```scheme
(for/list ((n (in-range 1 101)))
          (mobius n))
```

```
'(1 -1 -1 0 1 -1 0 1 0 1 -1 0 -1 1 -1 0 1 0 1 -1 0 -1 1 0 1 -1 0 -1 1 -1 0 1 0 1 -1 0 -1 1 -1 0 1 0 1 -1 0 -1 1 0 1 -1 0 -1 1 -1 0 1 0 1 -1 0 -1 1 -1 0 1 0 1 -1 0 -1 1 -1 0 1 0 1)
