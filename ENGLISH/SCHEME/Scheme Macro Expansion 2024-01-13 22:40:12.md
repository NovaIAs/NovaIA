Explanation:

1. `(define-syntax (my-syntax lambda-list body))`: This defines a new syntax rule called `my-syntax`. It takes two arguments: `lambda-list` and `body`. The `lambda-list` is a list of parameters for the macro, and the `body` is the code that will be executed when the macro is used.

2. `(define-values (lambdas body) ...)`: This uses the `define-values` special form to extract two values from the `body` of the macro: `lambdas` and `body`. The `lambdas` variable will be a list of lambda expressions, and the `body` variable will be the remaining code in the macro's body.

3. `(syntax-case body ...)`: This uses the `syntax-case` special form to analyze the structure of the `body` code. It matches the `body` code against a series of patterns, and executes the corresponding code for each pattern.

4. `((list . rest))`: This pattern matches a list whose first element is a list. The `list` variable will be bound to the first element of the list, and the `rest` variable will be bound to the rest of the list.

5. `(list (lambda lambdas (car rest)) (cons 'my-syntax (cdr rest)))`: This code creates a new list. The first element of the list is a lambda expression that takes the `lambdas` and `rest` variables as arguments. The body of the lambda expression is the code in the `rest` variable. The second element of the list is a call to the `cons` function, which creates a new list by adding the `'my-syntax` symbol to the front of the `rest` variable.

6. `(else (list (lambda lambdas body) '()))`: This is the default case for the `syntax-case` expression. It matches any code that doesn't match any of the other patterns. In this case, it creates a list containing a lambda expression and an empty list. The lambda expression takes the `lambdas` and `body` variables as arguments, and its body is the `body` variable.

7. `(fold-right append '() (map 'syntax->expression lambdas))`: This code uses the `fold-right` function to concatenate the lambda expressions in the `lambdas` list into a single list. The `append` function is used to concatenate the lists, and the `map` function is used to convert each lambda expression to an expression that can be evaluated by the Scheme interpreter.

8. `(define (my-macro x y) (display (list x y)))`: This defines a macro called `my-macro`. It takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, and its body is a call to the `display` function, which prints the values of `x` and `y` to the console.

9. `(define (my-macro-usage) (my-syntax ...))`: This defines a function called `my-macro-usage`. It calls the `my-syntax` macro with a lambda expression as its body. The lambda expression takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, and its body is a call to the `display` function, which prints the values of `x` and `y` to the console, followed by a call to the `display` function, which prints the values of `(+ x y)` and `(- x y)` to the console.

10. `(my-macro-usage)`: This calls the `my-macro-usage` function, which in turn calls the `my-syntax` macro. The `my-syntax` macro expands to a lambda expression, which is then evaluated by the Scheme interpreter. The lambda expression calls the `display` function twice, printing the values of `x` and `y`, and the values of `(+ x y)` and `(- x y)` to the console.
