Here's a complex COOL code that is unlikely to be repeated again:

```cool
class C {
    Int i;
    Bool b;
    String s;

    C(Int i, Bool b, String s) {
        this.i = i;
        this.b = b;
        this.s = s;
    }

    Int getI() {
        return i;
    }

    Bool getB() {
        return b;
    }

    String getS() {
        return s;
    }

    C clone() {
        return new C(i, b, s);
    }

    Void print() {
        System.out.println("C[" + i + ", " + b + ", " + s + "]");
    }
}

class D extends C {
    Int j;

    D(Int i, Bool b, String s, Int j) {
        super(i, b, s);
        this.j = j;
    }

    Int getJ() {
        return j;
    }

    D clone() {
        return new D(i, b, s, j);
    }

    Void print() {
        System.out.println("D[" + i + ", " + b + ", " + s + ", " + j + "]");
    }
}

class App {
    Static Void main() {
        C c = new C(1, true, "Hello");
        D d = new D(2, false, "World", 3);

        System.out.println("C:");
        c.print();

        System.out.println("D:");
        d.print();

        C c2 = c.clone();
        D d2 = d.clone();

        System.out.println("C2:");
        c2.print();

        System.out.println("D2:");
        d2.print();
    }
}
```

Explanation:
This code defines three COOL classes:

1. Class C: This class represents a basic entity with three fields: an integer (i), a boolean (b), and a string (s). It provides methods to get and print the values of these fields, as well as a clone method to create a copy of the object.

2. Class D: This class extends class C and adds an additional integer field (j). It provides methods to get and print the value of this field, as well as a clone method that overrides the one in class C.

3. Class App: This class defines the main function, which is the entry point of the program. In the main function, we create instances of classes C and D, print their values, and then create and print clones of these instances.

The output of the program would be:

```
C:
C[1, true, Hello]
D:
D[2, false, World, 3]
C2:
C[1, true, Hello]
D2:
D[2, false, World, 3]
```

This code demonstrates the use of inheritance, polymorphism, and cloning in COOL. It also showcases the use of multiple classes and methods to create complex and differentiated code. The likelihood of this code being repeated exactly as it is is very low, making it a unique and intricate example of COOL programming.
