Explanation:

* The `Main` class contains the `main` method, which is the entry point of the program.
* The `main` method initializes the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`.
* The `main` method then performs some calculations on the variables.
* The `main` method prints the results of the calculations.
* The `main` method returns the value `0`.
