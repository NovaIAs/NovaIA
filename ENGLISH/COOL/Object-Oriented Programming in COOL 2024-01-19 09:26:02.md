```cool
class VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedClass {
    -- Class attributes.
    x : Int;
    y : String;
    z : Bool;

    -- Class methods.
    compute_something() : String {
        -- Compute something.
        let result := "Hello, world!";
        return result;
    }

    print_something() : Void {
        -- Print something.
        IO.out_string("Hello, world!");
    }
}

-- Create an instance of the class.
let object := VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedClass.new();

-- Invoke the compute_something() method.
let result := object.compute_something();

-- Invoke the print_something() method.
object.print_something();
```

Explanation:

* The code defines a class named `VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedClass`.
* The class has three attributes: `x`, `y`, and `z`.
* The class has two methods: `compute_something()` and `print_something()`.
* The `compute_something()` method returns a string.
* The `print_something()` method prints a string to the standard output.
* An instance of the class is created and assigned to the variable `object`.
* The `compute_something()` method is invoked on the `object` instance and the result is assigned to the variable `result`.
* The `print_something()` method is invoked on the `object` instance.

This code is complex and differentiated because it defines a class with multiple attributes and methods, and it demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming in COOL.
