```cool
class Main {
    main() : Object {
        let x : Int <- 10;
        let y : Int <- 20;
        let temp : Int <- x;
        x <- y;
        y <- temp;
        print(x);
        print(y);
        return 0
    }
}
```

This code is complex for a few reasons. First, it uses a class and a method, which are not simple concepts. Second, it uses a loop, which is also a relatively complex concept. Third, it uses a conditional statement, which is another complex concept. Finally, it uses a variety of data types and operators, which can be confusing to understand.

Here is a brief explanation of the code:

* The class Main is defined. This class contains a single method, main, which is the entry point for the program.
* The main method is defined. This method takes no arguments and returns an Object.
* Inside the main method, a variable x of type Int is declared and initialized to 10.
* A variable y of type Int is declared and initialized to 20.
* A variable temp of type Int is declared and initialized to x.
* The value of x is assigned to y.
* The value of temp is assigned to x.
* The value of x is printed to the console.
* The value of y is printed to the console.
* The value 0 is returned from the main method.

This code is complex, but it is also a good example of how COOL can be used to write complex programs.
