This code is a very large and differentiated code in COOL. It is hard to repeat again because it is very complex and contains a lot of different features of the language. The code has been explained below:

- The `Main` class is the entry point of the program. The `main` method is the first method that is called when the program is executed.

- The `main` method contains a lot of different statements, including:
  - Variable declarations
  - Assignment statements
  - While loops
  - If statements
  - For loops
  - Object creation
  - Array creation
  - Matrix creation
  - Method calls
  - Printing statements

- The code uses a variety of data types, including:
  - Int
  - String
  - Bool
  - Object
  - Int[]
  - Int[][]

- The code uses a variety of operators, including:
  - Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)
  - Comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=)
  - Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
  - Assignment operator (=)

- The code uses a variety of control structures, including:
  - While loops
  - If statements
  - For loops

- The code uses a variety of objects, including:
  - `Object` objects
  - `Int[]` arrays
  - `Int[][]` matrices

- The code uses a variety of methods, including:
  - `print_int()`
  - `print_string()`
  - `print_bool()`
  - `print_object()`
  - `print_int_array()`
  - `print_int_matrix()`

- The code is very complex and it is hard to understand. However, it is a good example of how to use the COOL language.
