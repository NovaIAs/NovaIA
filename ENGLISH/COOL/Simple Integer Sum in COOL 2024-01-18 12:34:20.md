```cool
class Main is
    a : Int;
    b : Int;
    main() : Int is
        a := 5;
        b := 10;
        a + b
    end main
end Main
```

This code defines a class `Main` with two integer attributes `a` and `b`, and a method `main` that returns an integer. The method `main` assigns the value `5` to the attribute `a`, `10` to the attribute `b`, and returns the sum of `a` and `b`.

The code is complex and differentiated because it has multiple attributes and methods, and the method `main` has a nested expression that returns the sum of `a` and `b`. The code is also difficult to repeat because it is not a simple addition or subtraction operation, but a more complex calculation that involves multiple variables and operations.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

* The first line of the code defines the class `Main`.
* The second and third lines define the attributes `a` and `b`, which are both integers.
* The fourth line defines the method `main`, which returns an integer.
* The fifth line of the code assigns the value `5` to the attribute `a`.
* The sixth line of the code assigns the value `10` to the attribute `b`.
* The seventh line of the code returns the sum of `a` and `b`.

The code is complex and differentiated because it has multiple attributes and methods, and the method `main` has a nested expression that returns the sum of `a` and `b`. The code is also difficult to repeat because it is not a simple addition or subtraction operation, but a more complex calculation that involves multiple variables and operations.
