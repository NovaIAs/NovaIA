Explanation:

- The `fn` variable is a constant array of strings.
- The `explicit_tag_expr` variable is a string that is assigned the value of "Hello" if the condition `true` is true, and "World" otherwise.
- The `fn` function takes an integer as an argument and returns an integer.
- The `main` function is the entry point of the program.
- The `s` variable is a string that is initially assigned the value of the first element of the `fn` array.
- The `n` variable is an integer that is initially assigned the value of 10.
- The `b` variable is a boolean that is initially assigned the value of `true`.
- The `a` variable is an array of integers that is initially assigned the values from 1 to 10.
- The `i` variable is an integer that is initially assigned the value of 0.
- The `while` loop runs as long as `i` is less than 10.
- The `if` statement checks if `i` is equal to 5. If it is, the loop is exited using the `break` statement.
- The `if` statement checks if `i` is equal to 7. If it is, the next iteration of the loop is skipped using the `continue` statement.
- The `while` loop runs as long as `b` is true.
- The `for` loop runs for each element of the `a` array.
- The `s` variable is assigned the value of the concatenation of the `s` variable, the `fn[1]` string, the `fn[2]` string, and the string representation of the current element of the `a` array.
- The `s` variable is assigned the value of the concatenation of the `s` variable and the `explicit_tag_expr` variable.
- The `s` variable is assigned the value of the concatenation of the `s` variable and the result of calling the `fn` function with the argument 10.
- The `System.print_string` function prints the value of the `s` variable to the console.
- The `System.print_int` function prints the value of the `10` integer to the console.
- The `System.print_bool` function prints the value of the `true` boolean to the console.
- The `System.print_bool` function prints the value of the `false` boolean to the console.
- The `System.print_string` function prints an empty string to the console.
- The `System.print_nl` function prints a newline character to the console.
