This program is a simple counter that increments and decrements a value.
The class Counter has three attributes:
* counter: the value of the counter
* increment: a method that increments the counter by 1
* decrement: a method that decrements the counter by 1
* get_count: a method that returns the value of the counter

The class Main has one method:
* main: the main method that is called when the program is run

The main method creates a new instance of the Counter class and then calls the increment method three times.
It then calls the get_count method to get the value of the counter and prints it to the console.

The output of the program is:

```
Count: 3
```
