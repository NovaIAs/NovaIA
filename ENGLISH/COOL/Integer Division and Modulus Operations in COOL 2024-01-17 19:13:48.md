**Program:** Complex COOL Code

```cool
class IntDiv {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int dividend = 10;
    int divisor = 3;
    if (divisor != 0) {
      int quotient = dividend / divisor;
      int remainder = dividend % divisor;
      System.out.println("Quotient: " + quotient);
      System.out.println("Remainder: " + remainder);
    } else {
      System.out.println("Division by zero is undefined.");
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

This program demonstrates integer division and modulus operations in COOL. It includes the following features:

1. **Class Definition:** The program defines a new class named `IntDiv`. This class is used to encapsulate the division-related functionality and serves as a container for the `main` method.

2. **`main` Method:** The `main` method is the entry point of the program. It is a static method of the `IntDiv` class and is automatically invoked when the program runs.

3. **Variable Declarations:** Within the `main` method, several variables are declared:
   - `dividend`: An integer variable initialized to the value 10.
   - `divisor`: An integer variable initialized to the value 3.
   - `quotient` and `remainder`: Integer variables to store the quotient and remainder of the division operation, respectively.

4. **Conditional Statement:** A conditional statement (`if-else`) is used to check if the `divisor` is not zero. If the `divisor` is zero, it means division by zero would occur, and the program prints an appropriate message.

5. **Arithmetic Operations:** If the `divisor` is not zero, the program calculates the quotient and remainder using the `/` and `%` operators, respectively. The division operator (`/`) performs integer division, returning the quotient, while the modulus operator (`%`) returns the remainder.

6. **Output:** Finally, the program prints the calculated quotient and remainder using `System.out.println`.

This program showcases various programming concepts such as class definition, method invocation, variable declarations, conditional statements, arithmetic operations, and input/output handling in COOL. It also highlights the importance of checking for division by zero to avoid undefined behavior in the program.
