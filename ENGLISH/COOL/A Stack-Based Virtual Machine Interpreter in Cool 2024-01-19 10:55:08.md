-- This Cool program implements an interpreter for a simple stack-based virtual machine.

-- The machine has a stack of 32-bit integers and a program counter that points to the next
-- instruction to be executed. The instructions are:

--   PUSH n: Push the 32-bit integer n onto the stack.
--   POP: Pop the top element of the stack and discard it.
--   ADD: Pop the top two elements of the stack, add them together, and push the result onto
--       the stack.
--   SUB: Pop the top two elements of the stack, subtract the second from the first, and
--       push the result onto the stack.
--   MUL: Pop the top two elements of the stack, multiply them together, and push the result
--       onto the stack.
--   DIV: Pop the top two elements of the stack, divide the first by the second, and push the
--       result onto the stack.
--   MOD: Pop the top two elements of the stack, take the remainder of the first divided by
--       the second, and push the result onto the stack.
--   AND: Pop the top two elements of the stack, perform a bitwise AND operation on them, and
--       push the result onto the stack.
--   OR: Pop the top two elements of the stack, perform a bitwise OR operation on them, and
--      push the result onto the stack.
--   XOR: Pop the top two elements of the stack, perform a bitwise XOR operation on them, and
--       push the result onto the stack.
--   NOT: Pop the top element of the stack, perform a bitwise NOT operation on it, and push the
--       result onto the stack.
--   JMP n: Jump to the instruction at address n.
--   JZ n: If the top element of the stack is zero, jump to the instruction at address n.
--   JNZ n: If the top element of the stack is not zero, jump to the instruction at address n.

-- The Cool program first defines the data types used by the interpreter.

class Machine {
    % The stack is represented as an array of 32-bit integers.
    stack: array[32] of INTEGER;
    % The program counter points to the next instruction to be executed.
    pc: INTEGER;
};

-- The Cool program then defines the instructions that the interpreter can execute.

class Instruction {
    % The opcode specifies the operation to be performed.
    opcode: INTEGER;
    % The operand is a 32-bit integer that is used by some instructions.
    operand: INTEGER;
};

-- The Cool program then defines the interpreter itself.

class Interpreter {
    machine: Machine;
    instructions: array[1024] of Instruction;

    -- The constructor initializes the interpreter.
    constructor initialize(instructions: array[1024] of Instruction) {
        machine := new Machine;
        self.instructions := instructions;
    }

    -- The execute method runs the interpreter.
    method execute() {
        while (machine.pc < 1024) {
            instruction := self.instructions[machine.pc];
            case instruction.opcode of

                POP:

                    machine.stack[machine.stack.top - 2] := operand1 + operand2;
                    machine.stack.top := machine.stack.top - 1;
                SUB:
