```cool
class Main {
  main() -> Int {
    let x <- 10;
    if (x < 10) then {
      x <- x + 1;
    } else {
      x <- x - 1;
    };
    x
  }
}
```

This code defines a class called Main with a single method called main. The main method returns an integer and takes no arguments.

The first line of the main method declares a variable x and initializes it to the value 10. The next line uses an if statement to check if x is less than 10. If it is, then the value of x is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of x is decremented by 1.

The last line of the main method returns the value of x.

This code is complex because it uses a number of different features of the COOL language, including classes, methods, variables, if statements, and arithmetic operators. It is also difficult to predict the output of the code without carefully examining the code.
