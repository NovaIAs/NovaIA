```cool
class Main inherits Object {
  main() : String {
    Int i : 1;
    Int j : 2;
    Int k : 0;
    while (i < 10) then
      if (j < 10) then
        k : k + i + j;
        j : j + 1;
      else
        j : 1;
      fi;
      i : i + 1;
    fi;
    return k.asString;
  };
};
```
**Explanation:**

* The `Main` class inherits from the `Object` class, which is the base class for all objects in COOL.
* The `main` method is the entry point for the program. It returns a `String` value, which is printed to the console when the program runs.
* The `i`, `j`, and `k` variables are declared and initialized.
* The `while` loop runs until `i` is greater than or equal to 10.
* Inside the `while` loop, the `if` statement checks if `j` is less than 10. If it is, then `k` is incremented by the sum of `i` and `j`, and `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `j` is reset to 1.
* After the `if` statement, `i` is incremented by 1.
* The `return` statement returns the value of `k` as a string.

The output of this program is:
