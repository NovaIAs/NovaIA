This code is a collection of different functions that perform various tasks. It includes functions to print "Hello, world!", calculate the factorial of a number, perform merge sort on a list, calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle, and check if a rectangle contains a given point. These functions are grouped into modules to organize and structure the code.

Here are some explanations for each function:

- `hello_world`: This function simply prints "Hello, world!" to the console.

- `factorial`: This function calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer `n`. It uses a recursive approach, with a base case for `n == 0` returning 1, and for other values of `n`, it multiplies `n` by the factorial of `n-1`.

- `merge_sort`: This function implements the merge sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers in ascending order. It uses a recursive approach, dividing the list into smaller sublists, sorting them, and then merging them back together.

- `area` and `perimeter`: These functions calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle, respectively. They take a rectangle struct as an argument, which contains four values: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, representing the coordinates of the rectangle's corners.

- `contains?`: This function checks if a given point is contained within a rectangle. It takes a rectangle struct and a point struct as arguments and returns `true` if the point is inside the rectangle and `false` otherwise.

Overall, this code demonstrates several programming concepts, including functions, recursion, algorithm implementation, and structured data representation using modules and structs.
