This code is a Diffbot API client written in Elixir. It provides a simple interface for making requests to the Diffbot API. The client can be used to get article summaries, product information, image recognition results, and sentiment analysis results.

The client is organized into several modules:

* The `Diffbot` module is the main client module. It contains the functions for making requests to the API.
* The `Tesla` module is a library for making HTTP requests in Elixir. It is used by the `Diffbot` module to make API requests.
* The `Enum` module is a library for working with lists in Elixir. It is used by the `Diffbot` module to convert query parameters to a format that is compatible with the API.

The client is used as follows:

```elixir
iex> Diffbot.get_article_summary("https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/world/asia/china-tariffs.html")
{:ok, %{
  "article" => %{
    "title" => "China Tariffs: Trumpâ€™s Latest Shot at Trade",
    "content" => "...",
    "author" => "Keith Bradsher",
    "date" => "2018-03-08T00:00:00Z",
    "url" => "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/world/asia/china-tariffs.html"
  }
}}
```

This code makes a request to the Diffbot API to get the article summary for the URL `https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/world/asia/china-tariffs.html`. The response from the API is a map containing the article summary.

The client can be used to make other types of requests to the API, such as getting product information, image recognition results, and sentiment analysis results.
