```

This is a complex and differentiated code in ELIXIR. It is a module that provides functions to import and export data in different formats, such as CSV, JSON, and XML.

The module has six functions:

* `read_csv/1`: reads a CSV file and returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the CSV file.
* `write_csv/2`: writes a list of lists to a CSV file.
* `read_json/1`: reads a JSON file and returns a data structure representing the JSON data.
* `write_json/2`: writes a data structure to a JSON file.
* `read_xml/1`: reads an XML file and returns an XML document.
* `write_xml/2`: writes an XML document to an XML file.

All of the functions take a filename as their first argument. The `read_csv/1`, `read_json/1`, and `read_xml/1` functions also return the data in the file as a data structure. The `write_csv/2`, `write_json/2`, and `write_xml/2` functions write the data to the file.

The code uses the `File` module to read and write files. It also uses the `String` module to split the CSV file into rows and columns. The `Jason` module is used to encode and decode JSON data. The `Xoml` module is used to parse and generate XML documents.

This code is complex and differentiated because it provides a way to import and export data in different formats. This is a common task that is needed in many different applications. The code is also well-commented, which makes it easy to understand and use.
