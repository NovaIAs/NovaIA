```elixir
defmodule MyComplexModule do
  def some_complex_function(input) do
    # Do some complex stuff with the input
    # This could be a very long and complex calculation
    # or a series of operations
    result = input |> do_something() |> do_something_else() |> do_even_more()

    # Return the result
    result
  end

  defp do_something(input) do
    # Define a private helper function
    # This function performs some specific operation on the input
    # and returns the result
    input + 1
  end

  defp do_something_else(input) do
    # Define another private helper function
    # This function performs a different operation on the input
    # and returns the result
    input * 2
  end

  defp do_even_more(input) do
    # Define a third private helper function
    # This function performs yet another operation on the input
    # and returns the result
    input - 1
  end
end
```

This code defines a complex function called `some_complex_function` that performs a series of complex calculations on the input data. The function uses private helper functions (`do_something`, `do_something_else`, and `do_even_more`) to perform specific operations on the input data. The helper functions are defined using the `defp` macro, which defines a private function that is only accessible within the current module.

To use the `some_complex_function` function, you would call it like this:

```elixir
result = MyComplexModule.some_complex_function(10)
```

This would call the `some_complex_function` function with the input value of 10. The function would then perform the complex calculations and return the result, which would be assigned to the `result` variable.

This code is complex and difficult to understand because it performs a series of complex calculations using private helper functions. However, it is also a good example of how to use private helper functions to organize and structure complex code.
