This code creates a complex and differentiated workflow in Elixir using the ExMachina library. The workflow consists of four states: initial, in_progress, completed, and failed. Each state has a set of transitions that can be used to move the workflow from one state to another. The workflow also defines two types of data that can be stored in the workflow: task and data.

The code first imports the necessary libraries. Then, it creates a new data layer, a new state workflow, and defines the states and types of data that the workflow can use. Next, it creates a new task and starts the task in the initial state. The task is then completed and the status of the task is retrieved and printed.

This code is complex and differentiated because it uses the ExMachina library to create a workflow with multiple states, transitions, and types of data. It also demonstrates how to use the ExMachina library to start a task, complete a task, and retrieve the status of a task.
