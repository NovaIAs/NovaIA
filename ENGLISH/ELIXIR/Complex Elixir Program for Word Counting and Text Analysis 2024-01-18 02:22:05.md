This code is a complex Elixir program that demonstrates the use of higher-order functions, pattern matching, and other advanced features of the language. It includes functions for splitting a string into words, counting the occurrences of each word, and analyzing a list of strings. The output of the program is a list of maps, where each map contains the word counts for a corresponding string in the input list.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `split_into_words/1`: This function takes a string as an argument and returns a list of words by splitting the string on whitespace characters.
   - `count_words/1`: This function takes a list of words as an argument and returns a map of word counts. It uses the `Enum.reduce/3` function to iterate over the list of words and update the map with the count of each word.
   - `analyze_text/1`: This function takes a string as an argument and returns a map of word counts by combining the functionality of the `split_into_words/1` and `count_words/1` functions.
   - `analyze_texts/1`: This function takes a list of strings as an argument and returns a list of maps of word counts by applying the `analyze_text/1` function to each string in the input list.

2. **Usage**:
   - A list of sample texts is defined using the `texts` variable.
   - The `analyze_texts/1` function is called with the `texts` list as an argument, and the result is stored in the `results` variable.
   - The `IO.inspect/1` function is used to print the `results` variable to the console.

The output of the program is a list of maps, where each map contains the word counts for a corresponding string in the input list. This program demonstrates the power of Elixir for text analysis and data manipulation tasks.
