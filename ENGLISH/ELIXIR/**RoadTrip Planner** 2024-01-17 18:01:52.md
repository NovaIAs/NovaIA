This code defines an Elixir module called `RoadTrip` that helps you plan a road trip. The `main` function gets the starting and ending locations, calculates the distance and estimated travel time, and generates a list of stops along the way. The `get_distance`, `get_travel_time`, `get_stops`, and `get_stop_name` functions are helper functions that perform specific tasks.

The code uses a simplified approach to calculate the distance and travel time, as well as generate the list of stops. In a real-world application, you would typically use an API or service to get more accurate and detailed information.
