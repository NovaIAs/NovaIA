    case input do
      :option1 ->
        IO.puts "Option 1 was selected."

      :option2 ->
        IO.puts "Option 2 was selected."

      _ ->
        IO.puts "Invalid option selected."
    end

    # Perform some complex calculations
    result = calculate_something(input)

    # Return the result
    result

Explanation:

1. We define a module called `MyApp.ComplexCode`. This module will contain our complex function.


2. Inside the module, we define a function called `complex_function`. This function takes one argument, `input`, which can be any value.


3. The `case` statement is used to handle different values of the `input` argument. If the value of `input` is `:option1`, then the `IO.puts` function is called to print the message "Option 1 was selected." to the console. Similarly, if the value of `input` is `:option2`, then the `IO.puts` function is called to print the message "Option 2 was selected." to the console. If the value of `input` is anything else, then the `IO.puts` function is called to print the message "Invalid option selected." to the console.


4. After handling the different values of the `input` argument, we perform some complex calculations using the `calculate_something` function. The result of these calculations is stored in the `result` variable.


5. The `calculate_something` function is a private function that is defined inside the `MyApp.ComplexCode` module. This function takes one argument, `input`, and performs some complex calculations on it. The result of these calculations is returned as the value of the function.


6. Finally, the `result` variable is returned as the result of the `complex_function` function.
