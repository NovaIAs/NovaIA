Explanation:

1. The `MyComplexModule` is created as a module in Elixir. Modules are used to organize code and encapsulate related functions.

2. The `complex_function` function is defined with one parameter, `input`. It is the entry point to the complex calculations.

3. Inside `complex_function`, we first check if `input` is a list using `is_list/1`. If it is a list, we map the `complex_function` to each element of the list using `Enum.map/2`. This means the function will be applied to each element of the list individually.

4. If `input` is not a list (i.e., it's a single value), we perform complex calculations using the `complex_calculation/1` function. The result of this calculation is stored in the `result` variable.

5. We then check if `result` is greater than 100 using an `if` statement. If it is, we divide `result` by 2. If it's not, we multiply `result` by 3.

6. Finally, we return the modified `result` as the output of the `complex_function`.

7. The `complex_calculation/1` function is defined as a private function (indicated by `defp`) within the `MyComplexModule`. It is used to perform complex calculations on the input. In this example, we have used a placeholder `:ok` as the result, but in a real scenario, it would perform actual computations.

This code is complex because it combines multiple concepts in Elixir, such as pattern matching, recursion, list manipulation, and conditional statements. It also utilizes a private function for encapsulation. The specific calculations performed within the `complex_calculation/1` function would further add to the complexity of the code.
