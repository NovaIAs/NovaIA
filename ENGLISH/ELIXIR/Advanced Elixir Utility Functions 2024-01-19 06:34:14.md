Explanation:

1. `sum_numbers(numbers)`: This function takes a list of numbers and returns their sum. It uses the `Enum.reduce/3` function to iterate over the list and accumulate the sum.


2. `split_words(string)`: This function takes a string and returns a list of its words. It uses the `String.split/2` function to split the string on spaces.


3. `word_frequencies(words)`: This function takes a list of words and returns a map of the words and their frequencies. It uses the `Enum.reduce/3` function to iterate over the list and accumulate the frequencies.


4. `min_max(numbers)`: This function takes a list of numbers and returns a tuple containing the minimum and maximum values. It uses the `Enum.min_max/1` function to find the minimum and maximum values.


5. `prime_factors(number)`: This function takes a number and returns a list of its prime factors. It uses a loop to iterate over all the numbers from 2 to the number and checks if each number is a factor of the number. If it is, it adds the number to the list of prime factors.


6. `fibonacci(numbers)`: This function takes a list of numbers and returns a list of their Fibonacci numbers. It uses the `Enum.reduce/3` function to iterate over the list and accumulate the Fibonacci numbers.


7. `sorted_indices(numbers)`: This function takes a list of numbers and returns a list of their sorted indices. It uses the `Enum.sort/2` function to sort the numbers and then uses the `Enum.map/2` function to map each number to its index.


8. `tree_height(tree)`: This function takes a binary tree and returns its height. It uses a recursive function to traverse the tree and calculate its height.


9. `cumulative_sums(numbers)`: This function takes a list of numbers and returns a list of their cumulative sums. It uses the `Enum.reduce/3` function to iterate over the list and accumulate the cumulative sums.


10. `moving_averages(numbers, window_size)`: This function takes a list of numbers and a window size and returns a list of their moving averages. It uses a loop to iterate over the list and calculate the moving average for each window.


11. `standard_deviations(numbers)`: This function takes a list of numbers and returns a list of their standard deviations. It uses the `Enum.mean/1` function to calculate the mean of the numbers and then uses the `Enum.map/2` function to map each number to its standard deviation.


12. `variances(numbers)`: This function takes a list of numbers and returns a list of their variances. It uses the `Enum.mean/1` function to calculate the mean of the numbers and then uses the `Enum.map/2` function to map each number to its variance.


13. `covariances(numbers_a, numbers_b)`: This function takes two lists of numbers and returns their covariance. It uses the `Enum.zip/2` function to
