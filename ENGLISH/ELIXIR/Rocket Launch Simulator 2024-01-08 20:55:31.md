This code simulates the launch of a rocket. It defines a `Rocket` struct with fields for the rocket's name, type, payload, destination, launch date, launch time, whether the countdown has started, and the current countdown value.

The `new` function creates a new `Rocket` struct with the given values.

The `start_countdown` function starts the countdown for the rocket. It checks if the countdown has already started, and if not, it updates the rocket's `countdown_started` field to true and starts a new Task to decrement the countdown value every second.

The `decrement_countdown` function decrements the countdown value of the rocket. It checks if the countdown has reached 0, and if not, it decrements the countdown value and schedules the next decrement in 1 second.

The `launch_rocket` function launches the rocket. It prints a message to the console indicating that the rocket has launched.

The main part of the code creates a new `Rocket` struct, starts the countdown for the rocket, and then waits for the rocket to launch. It does this by calling the `start_countdown` function and then using a `while` loop to check if the rocket's `countdown_started` field is true. If the field is true, it means that the countdown is still running, so the code sleeps for 1 second and then checks again. Once the countdown is finished, the `while` loop exits and the `launch_rocket` function is called to launch the rocket.
