This code is a complex Elixir code that demonstrates various advanced features of the language. Here's an explanation of each part of the code:

1. `NestedModule` is a nested module inside the `ComplexElixirCode` module. It contains a function `nested_function/1` that multiplies a given number by 2.

2. `complex_macro/2` is a macro that generates a function definition at compile time. It takes a name and a list of arguments as input and returns a quoted expression that defines a function with the given name and arguments. The macro body uses the `quote` macro to generate the function definition.

3. `ComplexFunction` is a module that defines a function `complex_function/2` using the `complex_macro`. This function takes two arguments `x` and `y` and returns the sum of `x`, `y`, and the result of calling the `nested_function/1` function with `x` as an argument.

4. `complex_pipeline/1` is a function that takes a list as an input and applies a series of operations to it using the `Enum.reduce/3` function. It sums up all the elements in the list and returns the result.

5. `complex_map/1` is a function that takes a list as an input and applies a mapping function to each element in the list using the `Enum.map/2` function. It adds 1 to each element in the list and returns the resulting list.

6. `complex_filter/1` is a function that takes a list as an input and filters out elements from the list based on a condition using the `Enum.filter/2` function. It filters out all the odd numbers from the list and returns the resulting list.

This code demonstrates the use of nested modules, macros, function definitions, list transformations, and pattern matching in Elixir. It showcases the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
