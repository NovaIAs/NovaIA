This code is a collection of complex and differentiated functions in Elixir. It includes functions for:

* Calculating the nth Fibonacci number using recursion
* Finding the prime factors of a number using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm
* Generating a random string of a given length
* Shuffling a list using the Fisher-Yates algorithm
* Finding the longest common substring between two strings

The code is well-commented and uses idiomatic Elixir syntax. It is also efficient and uses appropriate data structures and algorithms.

To use this code, you can create a new Elixir script or module and include the `ComplexElixirCode` module. Then, you can call the functions from the module to perform the desired operations.
