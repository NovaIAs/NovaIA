This code defines five modules, `Factorial`, `Prime`, `Fibonacci`, `Perfect`, and `Amicable`, each of which defines a function to generate a list of numbers that satisfy a certain condition. The `Main` module uses these five modules to generate a list of numbers that satisfy all of the following conditions:

1. The number is a factorial of a number.
2. The number is a prime number.
3. The number is a Fibonacci number.
4. The number is a perfect number.
5. The number is an amicable number.

The `Factorial` module defines a function `fact` that calculates the factorial of a number. The `Prime` module defines a function `prime` that generates a list of prime numbers up to a given number. The `Fibonacci` module defines a function `fibonacci` that generates a list of Fibonacci numbers up to a given number. The `Perfect` module defines a function `perfect` that generates a list of perfect numbers up to a given number. The `Amicable` module defines a function `amicable` that generates a list of amicable numbers up to a given number.

The `Main` module defines a function `main` that uses the `Factorial`, `Prime`, `Fibonacci`, `Perfect`, and `Amicable` modules to generate a list of numbers that satisfy all of the conditions. The `main` function first generates a list of factorial numbers up to 100. Then, it filters the list of factorial numbers to only include prime numbers. Next, it filters the list of prime numbers to only include Fibonacci numbers. Then, it filters the list of Fibonacci numbers to only include perfect numbers. Finally, it filters the list of perfect numbers to only include amicable numbers.

The `main` function then prints the list of numbers that satisfy all of the conditions.
