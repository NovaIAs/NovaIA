    end
  end
end

YoutubeDL.start()
```

This code is a simple Elixir application that downloads videos from YouTube using the `youtube-dl` command-line tool.

The `start` function starts the application and creates a Task Supervisor. The Task Supervisor is responsible for managing and monitoring tasks that are run asynchronously. The `download_videos` function is then scheduled to run asynchronously using the Task Supervisor.

The `download_videos` function gets a list of video URLs from the `get_video_urls` function and then downloads each video using the `download_video` function.

The `get_video_urls` function returns a list of video URLs. In this example, the list contains three URLs, but in a real application, this list would be much larger.

The `download_video` function uses the `System.cmd` function to execute the `youtube-dl` command-line tool. The `youtube-dl` tool is used to download the video from the given URL.

The `try` expression is used to handle any errors that may occur while downloading the video. If an error occurs, the error message is logged using the `Logger` module.

The `YoutubeDL.start` function is called to start the application.

This code is complex because it uses multiple Elixir modules and functions, as well as the `youtube-dl` command-line tool. It is also complex because it handles errors and uses asynchronous tasks to download the videos.
