```lua
-- This Lua script implements a complex and highly differentiated code that is unlikely to be repeated again.

-- We define a function called 'spiral' that takes two parameters: a table of numbers and a function to be applied to each number in the table.
function spiral(numbers, func)
    -- We create an empty table to store the results of applying the function to each number in the table.
    local results = {}

    -- We define a variable 'direction' to keep track of the current direction we are moving in the table.
    local direction = 1

    -- We define a variable 'index' to keep track of the current index in the table.
    local index = 1

    -- We define a variable 'limit' to keep track of the limit of the table.
    local limit = #numbers

    -- We define a variable 'step' to keep track of the current step size.
    local step = 1

    -- We loop through the table until we reach the limit.
    while index <= limit do
        -- We apply the function to the number at the current index in the table and store the result in the results table.
        results[index] = func(numbers[index])

        -- We move to the next index in the table.
        index = index + direction * step

        -- We update the direction based on the current direction and step size.
        if direction == 1 and index > limit then
            direction = 2
            step = step + 1
            index = limit - step + 1
        elseif direction == 2 and index <= 1 then
            direction = 3
            step = step + 1
            index = step + 1
        elseif direction == 3 and index > limit then
            direction = 4
            step = step + 1
            index = limit - step + 1
        elseif direction == 4 and index <= 1 then
            direction = 1
            step = step + 1
            index = step + 1
        end
    end

    -- We return the results table.
    return results
end

-- We define a function called 'square' that takes a number as a parameter and returns the square of the number.
function square(number)
    return number * number
end

-- We define a function called 'cube' that takes a number as a parameter and returns the cube of the number.
function cube(number)
    return number * number * number
end

-- We call the spiral function with the table of numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and the square function.
local squared_numbers = spiral({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, square)

-- We call the spiral function with the table of numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and the cube function.
local cubed_numbers = spiral({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, cube)

-- We print the squared numbers.
print("Squared numbers:")
for i, number in pairs(squared_numbers) do
    print(i, number)
end

-- We print the cubed numbers.
print("Cubed numbers:")
for i, number in pairs(cubed_numbers) do
    print(i, number)
end
```

Explanation:

1. We define three functions: 'spiral', 'square', and 'cube'.
2. The 'spiral' function takes two parameters: a table of numbers and a function to be applied to each number in the table. It uses a spiral pattern to traverse the table and apply the function to each number.
3. The 'square' function takes a number as a parameter and returns the square of the number.
4. The 'cube' function takes a number as a parameter and returns the cube of the number.
5. We call the 'spiral' function twice: once with the table of numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and the 'square' function, and once with the table of numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and the 'cube' function.
6. We print the squared numbers and the cubed numbers.

This code is complex and highly differentiated because it uses a spiral pattern to traverse a table of numbers and apply a function to each number. It also uses two different functions, 'square' and 'cube', to calculate the square and cube of each number, respectively. The code is unlikely to be repeated again because it is very specific to the task of calculating the square and cube of a table of numbers using a spiral pattern.
