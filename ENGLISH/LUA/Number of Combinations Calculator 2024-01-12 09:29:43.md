```

This code is complex and differentiated because it combines two functions:

- The `combinations()` function calculates the number of possible combinations of a given set of elements.
- The `factorial()` function calculates the factorial of a number.

The code also checks for invalid input and handles errors gracefully.

Here is an example of how to use the code:

```lua
> lua combinations.lua
Enter the number of elements:
5
Enter the number of elements to choose:
3
The number of combinations is: 10
```

In this example, the user enters 5 as the number of elements and 3 as the number of elements to choose. The code then calculates the number of combinations and prints the result, which is 10.
