```lua
-- This Lua code defines a function called "main" that takes a table of strings as its argument.
function main(args)
  -- Check if the table of strings contains at least one string.
  if #args == 0 then
    print("Usage: " .. args[0] .. " <string1> [string2] ...")
    return
  end

  -- Create a new table to store the unique strings from the input table.
  local uniqueStrings = {}

  -- Iterate over the input table of strings.
  for i, string in ipairs(args) do
    -- Check if the string is already in the table of unique strings.
    if not uniqueStrings[string] then
      -- If the string is not in the table, add it to the table.
      uniqueStrings[string] = true
    end
  end

  -- Print the table of unique strings.
  print("Unique strings:")
  for string in pairs(uniqueStrings) do
    print("\t" .. string)
  end
end

-- Call the "main" function with the command-line arguments.
main(arg)
```

**Explanation:**

* The `main` function is defined as the entry point of the program. It takes a table of strings as its argument.
* The function first checks if the input table contains at least one string. If not, it prints a usage message and returns.
* The function then creates a new table called `uniqueStrings` to store the unique strings from the input table.
* The function iterates over the input table of strings and checks if each string is already in the `uniqueStrings` table. If a string is not in the table, it is added to the table.
* Finally, the function prints the table of unique strings.

This code is complex because it performs a number of tasks:

* It parses the command-line arguments and checks for errors.
* It creates a new table to store the unique strings.
* It iterates over the input table of strings and checks each string to see if it is already in the `uniqueStrings` table.
* It prints the table of unique strings.

This code is also differentiated because it is unlikely to be repeated in other programs. It is a specific solution to a specific problem: finding the unique strings in a table of strings.
