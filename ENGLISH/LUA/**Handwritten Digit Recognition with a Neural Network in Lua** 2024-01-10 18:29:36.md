**Explanation:**

1. **Load the MNIST Dataset:**
   - The code loads the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 handwritten digit images and their corresponding labels.

2. **Define the Neural Network Architecture:**
   - The network architecture consists of an input layer with 784 neurons (28x28 pixels), a hidden layer with 100 neurons, and an output layer with 10 neurons (10 digits).

3. **Initialize the Weights and Biases:**
   - The weights and biases for the network layers are randomly initialized.

4. **Define the Forward Pass Function:**
   - The forward pass function takes an input sample and propagates it through the network layers to produce an output prediction.

5. **Define the Loss Function:**
   - The loss function used is the cross-entropy loss, which measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the true labels.

6. **Define the Optimizer:**
   - The optimizer used is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which updates the network weights and biases based on the gradients of the loss function.

7. **Train the Neural Network:**
   - The network is trained for 10 epochs, iterating through the training data and updating the weights and biases in each epoch.

8. **Evaluate the Neural Network:**
   - After each epoch, the accuracy of the network is evaluated on the test data to track its performance.

9. **Save the Neural Network Model:**
   - Once the network is trained, the weights and biases are saved as a model file.

**Complexity and Uniqueness:**

- The code is complex due to the implementation of a neural network with multiple layers, forward and backward pass functions, loss function, optimizer, and training loop.

- It is also unique because it uses the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark for handwritten digit recognition, and trains a neural network to solve this specific task.

- The code is not likely to be repeated verbatim in other contexts, as it is tailored to the MNIST dataset and the specific neural network architecture used.
