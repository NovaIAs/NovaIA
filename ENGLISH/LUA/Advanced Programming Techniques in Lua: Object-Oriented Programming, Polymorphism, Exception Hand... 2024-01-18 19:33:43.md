```lua
-- This Lua script demonstrates advanced programming techniques, including:
-- - Object-oriented programming with classes and inheritance
-- - Polymorphism with virtual functions
-- - Exception handling with `pcall` and `xpcall`
-- - Functional programming with anonymous functions and closures
-- - Coroutines for concurrency and state management

-- Define a base class called "Shape" with a virtual function "draw()"
local Shape = {}
Shape.draw = function(self) end

-- Define a derived class called "Rectangle" that inherits from "Shape"
local Rectangle = {}
setmetatable(Rectangle, {__index = Shape})

-- Override the "draw()" function in the "Rectangle" class
Rectangle.draw = function(self)
    print("Drawing a rectangle with width " .. self.width .. " and height " .. self.height)
end

-- Define a derived class called "Circle" that inherits from "Shape"
local Circle = {}
setmetatable(Circle, {__index = Shape})

-- Override the "draw()" function in the "Circle" class
Circle.draw = function(self)
    print("Drawing a circle with radius " .. self.radius)
end

-- Define a function `drawShapes` that takes a table of shapes as input and calls the `draw()` function on each shape
local function drawShapes(shapes)
    for _, shape in ipairs(shapes) do
        shape:draw() -- Polymorphism: the `draw()` function is called differently depending on the type of shape
    end
end

-- Define an exception class called "ShapeError" to handle errors related to shapes
local ShapeError = {}
setmetatable(ShapeError, {__index = debug.error})

-- Define a function `validateShape` that takes a shape as input and checks if it is valid
local function validateShape(shape)
    if not shape then
        error("Shape cannot be nil") -- Raise an exception using `error()`
    elseif not shape.draw then
        error("Shape must have a `draw()` function")
    end
end

-- Define a coroutine function `drawShapesConcurrently` that uses concurrency to draw shapes in parallel
local function drawShapesConcurrently(shapes)
    local function drawShape(shape)
        pcall(validateShape, shape) -- Use `pcall` to handle errors in a coroutine
        shape:draw()
    end

    local coroutines = {}
    for _, shape in ipairs(shapes) do
        local coroutine = coroutine.create(drawShape, shape) -- Create a coroutine for each shape
        coroutines[#coroutines + 1] = coroutine
    end

    for _, coroutine in ipairs(coroutines) do
        coroutine.resume() -- Resume each coroutine to start drawing the shape
    end

    for _, coroutine in ipairs(coroutines) do
        xpcall(coroutine.resume) -- Use `xpcall` to handle errors in a coroutine
    end
end

-- Define a helper function `getShape` that creates and returns a shape object based on the given type
local function getShape(type, ...)
    local shape = nil

    if type == "rectangle" then
        shape = Rectangle(...)
    elseif type == "circle" then
        shape = Circle(...)
    end

    return shape
end

-- Define a function `drawUsingClosure` that uses a closure to draw shapes
local function drawUsingClosure()
    local drawShape = function(shape)
        shape:draw()
    end

    local shapes = {getShape("rectangle", 10, 20), getShape("circle", 5)} -- Create shapes using a helper function
    table.foreach(shapes, drawShape) -- Iterate over the shapes and call the closure for each shape
end

-- Demonstrate the different programming techniques in the script
drawShapes{getShape("rectangle", 10, 20), getShape("circle", 5)} -- Draw shapes using `drawShapes()`
drawShapesConcurrently{getShape("rectangle", 10, 20), getShape("circle", 5)} -- Draw shapes concurrently using `drawShapesConcurrently()`
drawUsingClosure() -- Draw shapes using a closure with `drawUsingClosure()`

This script demonstrates advanced programming techniques in Lua. It includes examples of object-oriented programming with classes and inheritance, polymorphism with virtual functions, exception handling with `pcall` and `xpcall`, functional programming with anonymous functions and closures, and concurrency using coroutines. It also includes a helper function `getShape` that creates and returns a shape object based on the given type, and a function `drawUsingClosure` that uses a closure to draw shapes.
