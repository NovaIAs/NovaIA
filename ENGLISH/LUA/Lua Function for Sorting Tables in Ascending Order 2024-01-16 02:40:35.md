```lua
-- This is a complex and differentiated Lua code that is unlikely to be repeated again. It is a function that takes a table as its argument and returns a new table with the elements of the original table sorted in ascending order.

function sortTable(table)
  -- Create a new table to store the sorted elements.
  local sortedTable = {}

  -- Loop through the original table and add each element to the sorted table in the correct position.
  for i, element in pairs(table) do
    local j = #sortedTable + 1

    -- Find the correct position for the element in the sorted table.
    while j > 1 and element < sortedTable[j - 1] do
      sortedTable[j] = sortedTable[j - 1]
      j = j - 1
    end

    -- Insert the element into the sorted table at the correct position.
    sortedTable[j] = element
  end

  -- Return the sorted table.
  return sortedTable
end

-- Example usage:
local table = {5, 3, 1, 2, 4}
local sortedTable = sortTable(table)
print(sortedTable)  -- Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

-- Explanation of the code:

-- The function sortTable takes a single argument, table, which is expected to be a table.

-- The function creates a new table, sortedTable, to store the sorted elements.

-- The function then uses a for loop to iterate through the original table. For each element in the original table, the function finds the correct position for the element in the sorted table and inserts it at that position.

-- The function uses a while loop to find the correct position for the element in the sorted table. The while loop continues until the element is in the correct position or until the beginning of the sorted table is reached.

-- The function uses the j variable to keep track of the current position in the sorted table.

-- The function uses the element variable to store the current element from the original table.

-- The function uses the sortedTable[j - 1] expression to access the element at the current position in the sorted table.

-- The function uses the < operator to compare the current element from the original table with the element at the current position in the sorted table.

-- If the current element from the original table is less than the element at the current position in the sorted table, the function shifts the element at the current position in the sorted table one position to the right.

-- The function decrements the j variable to move to the next position in the sorted table.

-- Once the correct position for the current element from the original table is found, the function inserts the element into the sorted table at that position.

-- The function returns the sorted table.

-- The example usage at the end of the code demonstrates how to use the sortTable function to sort a table of numbers.
