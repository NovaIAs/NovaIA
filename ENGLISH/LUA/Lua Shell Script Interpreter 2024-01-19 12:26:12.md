```lua
-- This Lua code implements a simple shell script interpreter.

-- Define the main function.
function main()
  -- Create a table to store the environment variables.
  local env = {}

  -- Create a table to store the commands.
  local commands = {}

  -- Read the environment variables from the command line.
  for i, arg in ipairs(arg) do
    if arg:match("^--") then
      local name, value = arg:match("^--([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)=(.*)$")
      env[name] = value
    end
  end

  -- Read the commands from the command line.
  for i, arg in ipairs(arg) do
    if not arg:match("^--") then
      commands[#commands + 1] = arg
    end
  end

  -- Execute the commands.
  for _, command in ipairs(commands) do
    -- Split the command into a table of arguments.
    local args = command:split(" ")

    -- Get the path to the command.
    local path = args[1]

    -- Get the arguments to the command.
    local args = table.concat(args, " ", 2)

    -- Execute the command.
    local status = os.execute(path, args)

    -- Print the output of the command.
    print(io.read("*a"))

    -- Check the status of the command.
    if status ~= 0 then
      error("Command failed: " .. command)
    end
  end
end

-- Call the main function.
main()
```

This code is a simple shell script interpreter. It reads the environment variables and commands from the command line, and then executes the commands. The code is well-commented and easy to understand.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

* The `main()` function is the entry point of the program.
* The `env` table is used to store the environment variables.
* The `commands` table is used to store the commands.
* The `for` loop iterates over the command-line arguments and reads the environment variables.
* The `for` loop iterates over the command-line arguments and reads the commands.
* The `os.execute()` function is used to execute the commands.
* The `io.read("*a")` function is used to read the output of the commands.
* The `error()` function is used to print an error message and exit the program.

This code is a good example of how to use Lua to write a simple script interpreter.
