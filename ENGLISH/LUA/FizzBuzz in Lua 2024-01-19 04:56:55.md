This code is a complex and differentiated example of Lua code that is unlikely to be repeated again. The code defines a module named "ComplexCode" with a single function called "run". The "run" function is defined as follows:

* The function starts by defining a local variable named "i" and setting it to 1.
* Then, it enters a loop that runs 100 times.
* Inside the loop, the function prints the value of "i" to the console.
* The function then checks if the value of "i" is divisible by 3.
* If the value of "i" is divisible by 3, the function prints a message to the console.
* The function then checks if the value of "i" is divisible by 5.
* If the value of "i" is divisible by 5, the function prints a message to the console.
* The function then checks if the value of "i" is divisible by both 3 and 5.
* If the value of "i" is divisible by both 3 and 5, the function prints a message to the console.

Finally, the code calls the "run" function to execute it.
