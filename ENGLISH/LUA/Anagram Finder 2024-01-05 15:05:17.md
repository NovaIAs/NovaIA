```lua
-- This Lua code defines a function called 'find_anagrams' that takes a list of words as input and returns a table containing all the anagrams found in the list.

function find_anagrams(word_list)
  -- Create an empty table to store the anagrams.
  local anagrams = {}

  -- Iterate over each word in the list.
  for i, word in ipairs(word_list) do
    -- Sort the characters of the word.

Explanation:

1. The `find_anagrams` function takes a list of words as input and returns a table containing all the anagrams found in the list.

2. Inside the function, an empty table called `anagrams` is created to store the anagrams.

3. The function then iterates over each word in the input list using a for loop.

4. For each word, the characters of the word are sorted using the `string.sort` function. This sorted word is used as a key in the `anagrams` table to group anagrams together.

5. The function checks if the sorted word is already in the `anagrams` table. If it is, the current word is added to the list of anagrams for that sorted word.

6. If the sorted word is not in the `anagrams` table, a new entry is created for the sorted word and the current word is added to it.

7. After processing all the words in the input list, the `anagrams` table is returned.

8. In the example usage, a list of words is provided and the `find_anagrams` function is called to find the anagrams in the list.

9. The anagrams found are then printed to the console, grouped by their sorted word.
