Certainly! Here's a complex and unique Lua code that generates a maze using the Depth-First Search algorithm:

```lua
-- Maze Generation using Depth-First Search Algorithm

-- Constants
local WIDTH = 20 -- Width of the maze
local HEIGHT = 20 -- Height of the maze

-- Initialize the maze with walls
local maze = {}
for i = 1, HEIGHT do
    maze[i] = {}
    for j = 1, WIDTH do
        maze[i][j] = 1
    end
end

-- Recursive Depth-First Search function
local function dfs(row, col)
    maze[row][col] = 0 -- Mark the current cell as visited

    -- Define the order in which the neighbors will be visited
    local directions = {
        {0, -2}, -- Up
        {2, 0}, -- Right
        {0, 2}, -- Down
        {-2, 0} -- Left
    }

    for _, direction in ipairs(directions) do
        local nextRow, nextCol = row + direction[1], col + direction[2]

        if nextRow >= 1 and nextRow <= HEIGHT and nextCol >= 1 and nextCol <= WIDTH and maze[nextRow][nextCol] == 1 then
            -- Remove the wall between the current cell and the next cell
            maze[row + direction[1] / 2][col + direction[2] / 2] = 0
            dfs(nextRow, nextCol)
        end
    end
end

-- Start DFS from a random cell
math.randomseed(os.time())
local startRow = math.random(1, HEIGHT)
local startCol = math.random(1, WIDTH)
dfs(startRow, startCol)

-- Print the maze
for i = 1, HEIGHT do
    for j = 1, WIDTH do
        if maze[i][j] == 0 then
            io.write("  ") -- Path
        else
            io.write("# ") -- Wall
        end
    end
    io.write("\n")
end
```

This Lua code generates a maze using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. 

The `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` constants define the dimensions of the maze. The code initializes a 2D array `maze` with walls marked as 1.

The `dfs` function implements the recursive DFS algorithm. It takes as input the current row and column and proceeds to mark the current cell as visited (0). It defines the order in which the neighboring cells will be visited (up, right, down, left). The function then recursively visits the unvisited neighboring cells, removing the walls between them.

The code randomly selects a starting cell and initiates the DFS algorithm from there. Finally, it prints the maze by iterating over the `maze` array and printing a space for the paths and a "#" for the walls.

You can adjust the `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` constants to generate mazes of different sizes. Enjoy exploring and solving the generated mazes!
