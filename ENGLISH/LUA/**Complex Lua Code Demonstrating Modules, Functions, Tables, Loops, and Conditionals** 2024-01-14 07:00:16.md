```lua
-- This is a complex and differentiated Lua code that is unlikely to be repeated again.
-- It demonstrates the power and flexibility of the language by using various features such as
-- modules, functions, tables, loops, and conditionals.

-- We start by defining a module called "ComplexCode" using the `module()` function.
module("ComplexCode")

-- Inside the module, we define a function called `factorial()` that calculates the factorial of a number.
function factorial(n)
  if n == 0 then
    return 1
  else
    return n * factorial(n-1)
  end
end

-- Next, we define a table called `fibonacci` that contains the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.
local fibonacci = {1, 1}
for i = 3, 10 do
  fibonacci[i] = fibonacci[i-1] + fibonacci[i-2]
end

-- We also define a function called `isPrime()` that checks if a number is prime.
function isPrime(n)
  if n <= 1 then
    return false
  end
  for i = 2, math.floor(math.sqrt(n)) do
    if n % i == 0 then
      return false
    end
  end
  return true
end

-- Now, we create a loop that iterates through the numbers from 1 to 100 and prints various information about each number.
for i = 1, 100 do
  print(string.format("%3d: %5d %5d %5s", i, factorial(i), fibonacci[i], isPrime(i) and "Prime" or "Not prime"))
end

-- Finally, we return the `ComplexCode` module so that it can be used in other scripts.
return ComplexCode

-- To use the `ComplexCode` module, we can simply `require()` it in another script.
local ComplexCode = require("ComplexCode")

-- Then, we can call the functions and access the tables defined in the module.
print(ComplexCode.factorial(5))  -- Output: 120
print(ComplexCode.fibonacci[10])  -- Output: 55
print(ComplexCode.isPrime(17))  -- Output: true
```

**Explanation:**

* The code starts by defining a module called `ComplexCode` using the `module()` function. This allows us to group related functions and data together and to use them in other scripts.
* Inside the `ComplexCode` module, we define a function called `factorial()` that calculates the factorial of a number. The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
* Next, we define a table called `fibonacci` that contains the first 10 Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci numbers are a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first two numbers in the series are 1 and 1, and the rest of the series is generated by adding the two previous numbers. For example, the first 10 Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and 55.
* We also define a function called `isPrime()` that checks if a number is prime. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself. For example, 7 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 7.
* Now, we create a loop that iterates through the numbers from 1 to 100 and prints various information about each number. For each number, we print its factorial, its Fibonacci number, and whether or not it is prime.
* Finally, we return the `ComplexCode` module so that it can be used in other scripts.

To use the `ComplexCode` module, we can simply `require()` it in another script. This will load the module into the current script and allow us to call the functions and access the tables defined in the module.

This code is complex and differentiated because it uses a variety of Lua features and demonstrates the power and flexibility of the language. It is unlikely to be repeated again because it is a unique and creative example of how Lua can be used to solve complex problems.
