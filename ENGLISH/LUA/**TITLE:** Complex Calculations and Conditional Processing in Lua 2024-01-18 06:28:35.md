-- This Lua code defines a complex function that takes an input number and performs various calculations on it. It demonstrates a combination of mathematical operations, conditional statements, and string manipulation.

-- Define the function named "complex_calculation"
function complex_calculation(input_number)

    -- Check if the input number is even or odd
    if input_number % 2 == 0 then
        -- If even, multiply the input number by itself
        even_result = input_number * input_number
    else
        -- If odd, add the input number to itself
        odd_result = input_number + input_number
    end

    -- Calculate the sum of the even result and the input number
    sum_result = even_result + input_number

    -- Calculate the absolute value of the sum result
    absolute_result = math.abs(sum_result)

    -- Check if the absolute result is greater than 100
    if absolute_result > 100 then
        -- If greater than 100, convert the absolute result to a string
        string_result = tostring(absolute_result)
    else
        -- If not greater than 100, set the string result to an empty string
        string_result = ""
    end

    -- Return the string result
    return string_result
end

-- Define the input number as 53
input_number = 53

-- Call the complex calculation function and store the result
result = complex_calculation(input_number)

-- Print the result to the console
print(result)
```

**Explanation:**

1. The "complex_calculation" function is defined to take one parameter, "input_number."

2. Inside the function, an if-else statement checks if the "input_number" is even (divisible by 2) or odd (not divisible by 2).

3. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, different calculations are performed:
   - If even, it multiplies the "input_number" by itself and stores the result in the "even_result" variable.
   - If odd, it adds the "input_number" to itself and stores the result in the "odd_result" variable.

4. The even result and the input number are added together to get the "sum_result."

5. The absolute value (non-negative value) of the "sum_result" is calculated using "math.abs."

6. Another if-else statement checks if the "absolute_result" is greater than 100:
   - If it is greater than 100, the "absolute_result" is converted to a string using "tostring" and stored in the "string_result" variable.
   - If it is not greater than 100, the "string_result" is set to an empty string.

7. Finally, the function returns the "string_result."

8. The code then defines the input number as 53.

9. The "complex_calculation" function is called with the input number as an argument, and the result is stored in the "result" variable.

10. The result is printed to the console using "print."
