```lua
-- Step 1: Prerequisites

-- To execute this code, you'll need:
--   A computer with Lua installed.
--   A text editor or IDE that supports Lua.
--   Basic understanding of Lua syntax and programming concepts.


-- Step 2: Initial Setup

-- Create a new Lua file. You can name it whatever you want. For this example, we'll call it "complex_lua_code.lua."
-- Open the file in your text editor or IDE.
-- Declare a global variable named "numbers" and initialize it with a table containing a set of numbers.
-- For instance: numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}


-- Step 3: Implementing Functions

-- Define a function called "sum_array" that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the elements in the array. Here's the code:

function sum_array(array)
    local sum = 0
    for i, number in ipairs(array) do
        sum = sum + number
    end
    return sum
end


-- Step 4: Using the Function

-- Call the "sum_array" function with the "numbers" array as an argument. Store the result in a variable named "total_sum."

total_sum = sum_array(numbers)


-- Step 5: Handling Exceptions

-- Inside the "sum_array" function, add an "if" statement to check if the input array is empty. If it is, return a message indicating that the sum cannot be calculated for an empty array.

function sum_array(array)
    if #array == 0 then
        return "Cannot calculate the sum of an empty array."
    end
    local sum = 0
    for i, number in ipairs(array) do
        sum = sum + number
    end
    return sum
end


-- Step 6: Working with Strings

-- Define a function named "reverse_string" that takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of that string. Here's how you can implement it:

function reverse_string(str)
    local reversed_str = ""
    for i = #str, 1, -1 do
        reversed_str = reversed_str .. string.sub(str, i, i)
    end
    return reversed_str
end


-- Step 7: Working with Tables

-- Create a table named "person" and populate it with information about a person. Include details like name, age, and occupation.
-- For example: person = {name = "John Doe", age = 30, occupation = "Software Engineer"}


-- Step 8: Table Operations

-- Using table operators, access and manipulate the data in the "person" table. For instance:
-- Get the person's name: print("Name:", person.name)
-- Increment the person's age: person.age = person.age + 1


-- Step 9: Conditional Statements

-- Implement a simple "if-else" statement to demonstrate conditional execution. Here's an example:

if person.occupation == "Software Engineer" then
    print("The person is a Software Engineer.")
else
    print("The person's occupation is not Software Engineer.")
end


-- Step 10: Loops

-- Utilize "for" and "while" loops to iterate over data structures and perform repetitive tasks. Here's an illustration:

-- Using a "for" loop to print the elements of the "numbers" array:
for i, number in ipairs(numbers) do
    print(number)
end

-- Using a "while" loop to count down from 10 to 1:
local counter = 10
while counter > 0 do
    print(counter)
    counter = counter - 1
end


-- Step 11: Conclusion

-- Save your Lua file ("complex_lua_code.lua") and run it to execute the code. You should see the expected outputs as per the implemented logic.
-- This code demonstrates a variety of programming concepts and techniques in Lua, including functions, table manipulation, conditional statements, and loops.
