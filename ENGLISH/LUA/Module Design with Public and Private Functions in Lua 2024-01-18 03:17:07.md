```lua
-- Define a module with a private variable
local MyModule = {}

-- Define a public function that can be called from outside the module
function MyModule.publicFunction()
  print("I am a public function in MyModule.")
  print("I can access privateVariable: " .. privateVariable)
end

-- Define a private function that can only be called from within the module

-- Call the private function from within the module

Explanation:

* We define a module named `MyModule` using the `local` keyword. Modules are used to encapsulate related functions and data, and they can be used to create objects.
* Inside the module, we define a private variable named `privateVariable` and initialize it to 10. Private variables are only accessible from within the module.
* We define a public function named `publicFunction` that can be called from outside the module. This function prints a message and accesses the `privateVariable`.
* We also define a private function named `privateFunction` that can only be called from within the module. This function also prints a message and accesses the `privateVariable`.
* We call the `privateFunction` from within the module using the `local` keyword. This is allowed because `privateFunction` is defined in the same scope as the `privateVariable`.
* We create an instance of the `MyModule` module and assign it to the variable `myModuleInstance`.
* We call the `publicFunction` from the instance using the `.` operator. This allows us to access the `publicFunction` function from the instance.
* Finally, we try to call the `privateFunction` from outside the module. This will fail because `privateFunction` is a private function and can only be called from within the module.
