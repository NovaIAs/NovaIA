Explanation:

* The code starts with a function definition for the word_frequency() function. This function takes a string as input and returns a table of all the words in the string, along with their frequencies.
* The first thing the function does is check if the input is a string. If the input is not a string, the function throws an error.
* The function then creates a table to store the word frequencies.
* The next step is to split the string into words. This is done using the gmatch() function. The gmatch() function takes a regular expression as its first argument and a string as its second argument. The regular expression used in this case is "[%w']+". This regular expression matches any word character or apostrophe.
* The function then iterates over the words using a for loop.
* For each word, the function converts the word to lowercase using the lower() method. This ensures that the word frequencies are case-insensitive.
* The function then checks if the word is already in the table. If the word is already in the table, the function increments its frequency. If the word is not in the table, the function adds it to the table and sets its frequency to 1.
* Finally, the function returns the table of word frequencies.
* The example usage section of the code shows how to use the word_frequency() function. The function is called with a sample string as input, and the resulting table of word frequencies is printed to the console.
