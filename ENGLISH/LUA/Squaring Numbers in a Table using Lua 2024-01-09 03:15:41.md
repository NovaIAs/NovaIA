```lua
-- This Lua code defines a complex and differentiated function that takes a table of numbers as input and returns a new table containing the squares of each number in the input table.

-- Define the function.
function square_table(numbers)
  -- Create a new empty table to store the squared numbers.
  local squared_numbers = {}

  -- Iterate over each number in the input table.
  for i, number in ipairs(numbers) do
    -- Calculate the square of the number.
    local squared_number = number * number

    -- Add the squared number to the new table.
    squared_numbers[i] = squared_number
  end

  -- Return the new table containing the squared numbers.
  return squared_numbers
end

-- Example usage.
local numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
local squared_numbers = square_table(numbers)

-- Print the squared numbers.
print("Squared numbers:")
for i, squared_number in ipairs(squared_numbers) do
  print(squared_number)
end

```

Explanation:

1. The function square_table is defined. It takes one parameter, numbers, which is expected to be a table containing numeric values.

2. Inside the function, a new empty table called squared_numbers is created. This table will be used to store the squared numbers.

3. A for loop is used to iterate over each number in the numbers table. The loop variable i represents the index of the current number, and number represents the actual value of the number.

4. Inside the loop, the square of the current number is calculated using the expression number * number. The result is stored in the variable squared_number.

5. The squared number is then added to the squared_numbers table at the index i.

6. After all the numbers in the input table have been processed, the squared_numbers table is returned as the result of the function.

7. In the example usage section, a table of numbers is defined and passed as an argument to the square_table function. The resulting squared_numbers table is then printed to the console.

This code demonstrates a complex and differentiated function that performs a specific task (squaring the numbers in a table) and returns a new table as the result. The function uses a loop to iterate over the input table, performs a calculation on each element, and stores the results in a new table. The example usage shows how the function can be used in practice.
