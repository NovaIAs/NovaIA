This code implements a neural network with one hidden layer. The network is trained using the backpropagation algorithm. The network is evaluated on a test dataset and the accuracy is printed.

The code is divided into several sections:

* **Define the network architecture.** This section defines the number of input, hidden, and output units, as well as the activation functions for each layer.
* **Initialize the weights and biases.** This section initializes the weights and biases for the hidden and output layers.
* **Define the loss function and optimizer.** This section defines the loss function and optimizer to be used for training the network.
* **Train the neural network.** This section trains the network for a specified number of epochs.
* **Evaluate the neural network.** This section evaluates the network on a test dataset and prints the accuracy.

The code is well-commented and easy to follow. It is a good example of how to implement a neural network in Lua.
