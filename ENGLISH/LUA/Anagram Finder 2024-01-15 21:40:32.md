```lua
-- This Lua code defines a function called `find_anagrams` that takes a list of words as input and returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains all the anagrams of a word from the input list.

function find_anagrams(words)
  -- Create a dictionary to store the anagrams.
  local anagrams = {}

  -- Iterate over each word in the input list.
  for i = 1, #words do
    -- Get the current word and convert it to lowercase.
    local word = words[i]:lower()

    -- Sort the characters in the word.
    local sorted_word = string.sort(word)

    -- Check if the sorted word is already in the dictionary.
    if anagrams[sorted_word] then
      -- If it is, append the current word to the list of anagrams for that sorted word.
      anagrams[sorted_word]:append(words[i])
    else
      -- If it is not, create a new list of anagrams for the sorted word and add the current word to it.
      anagrams[sorted_word] = {words[i]}
    end
  end

  -- Return the dictionary of anagrams.
  return anagrams
end

-- Example usage:
local words = {"cat", "act", "dog", "god", "bat", "tab"}
local anagrams = find_anagrams(words)

-- Print the results.

Explanation:

1. The `find_anagrams` function takes a list of words as input and returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains all the anagrams of a word from the input list.

2. It creates a dictionary called `anagrams` to store the anagrams.

3. It iterates over each word in the input list.

4. For each word, it converts it to lowercase and sorts the characters in the word.

5. It checks if the sorted word is already in the `anagrams` dictionary.

6. If it is, it appends the current word to the list of anagrams for that sorted word.

7. If it is not, it creates a new list of anagrams for the sorted word and adds the current word to it.

8. Finally, it returns the `anagrams` dictionary.

9. The example usage at the end of the code shows how to use the `find_anagrams` function to find the anagrams of a list of words and print the results.
