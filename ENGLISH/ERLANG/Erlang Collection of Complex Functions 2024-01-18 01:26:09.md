This code is a collection of different complex functions written in Erlang. It includes:

* A function to calculate the factorial of a number
* A function to calculate the sum of a list of numbers
* A function to generate a list of prime numbers up to a given limit
* A function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms
* A function to calculate the number of ways to climb a staircase with a given number of steps,
where you can take either 1 or 2 steps at a time
* A function to find all the subsets of a given list
* A function to calculate the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph,
using Dijkstra's algorithm

The code is well-commented and should be easy to understand. It is also quite complex, and it is unlikely that you will find a similar code easily.
