This code implements a simple server in Erlang that can handle requests from clients. The server can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.

The server is started using the `start_server()` function, which spawns a new process and registers it with the name `my_server_pid`. The `stop_server()` function can be used to stop the server.

Clients can send requests to the server using the `handle_request()` function. The function takes two arguments: the request itself and the PID of the client that sent the request.

The server handles requests in a loop. When a request is received, the server calls the `handle_request_internal()` function to process the request. The result of the request is then sent back to the client using the `!` operator.

The `handle_request_internal()` function takes a request as an argument and returns the result of the request. The function uses pattern matching to determine the type of request and then performs the appropriate operation.

This code demonstrates some of the key features of Erlang, including concurrency, message passing, and pattern matching. It also shows how to implement a simple server in Erlang.
