This code defines a module named `complex_code` with an export list that includes the `start/0` function. The `start/0` function creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10,000, filters the list to only include even numbers, maps the list of even numbers to their squares, sorts the list of squares in ascending order, and prints the list of sorted squares.

The code also defines a macro named `MACRO` with the value `"Hello, world!"`, a record named `person` with fields `name` and `age`, and three functions: `create_person/2` to create a person record, `print_name/1` to print the name of a person record, and `print_age/1` to print the age of a person record.
