Explanation:

1. `start/0` function: This function is the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to enter a positive integer for factorial calculation, two positive integers for greatest common divisor (GCD) calculation, a positive integer for Fibonacci calculation, and a positive integer for prime factors calculation. It then calls the respective functions to perform the calculations and display the results.

2. `factorial/1` function: This function calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer `N`. It uses a recursive approach, where the factorial of `N` is calculated as `N * factorial(N-1)`.

3. `gcd/2` function: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `A` and `B`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm, which involves finding the remainder when `A` is divided by `B`, and then recursively calling the function with `B` and the remainder as arguments.

4. `fibonacci/1` function: This function calculates the Fibonacci number at a given index `N`. It uses a recursive approach, where the Fibonacci number at index `N` is calculated as the sum of the Fibonacci numbers at indices `N-1` and `N-2`.

5. `prime_factors/1` function: This function calculates the prime factors of a positive integer `N`. It uses a recursive approach, where it iterates through numbers starting from 2 and checks if `N` is divisible by the current number. If `N` is divisible, it recursively calls the function with `N` divided by the current number and adds the current number to the list of prime factors.
