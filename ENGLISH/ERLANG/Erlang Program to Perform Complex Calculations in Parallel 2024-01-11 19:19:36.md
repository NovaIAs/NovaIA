```erlang
-module(complex_code).
-export([start/0]).

start() ->
    io:fwrite("Hello world!~n"),
    Pid = spawn(fun() -> complex_function() end),
    receive
        {Pid, Result} ->
            io:fwrite("The result is: ~p~n", [Result])
    end.

complex_function() ->
    % Do some complex calculations here
    Result = 12345,
    Pid = self(),
    Pid ! {Pid, Result}.
```

This code is a simple Erlang program that starts a process (using the `spawn` function) to perform a complex calculation. The main process (the one that calls the `start` function) waits for the result of the calculation to be sent back to it using the `receive` statement.

Here is a detailed explanation of the code:

* The `-module(complex_code).` line declares the name of the module, which is `complex_code`.
* The `-export([start/0]).` line declares that the `start` function is exported from the module, meaning that it can be called from other modules.
* The `start` function is the entry point of the program. It prints "Hello world!" to the console, and then spawns a new process using the `spawn` function. The new process is started by calling the `complex_function` function.
* The `Pid` variable stores the process ID of the new process.
* The `receive` statement is used to wait for messages to be sent to the current process. In this case, the current process is waiting for a message from the new process.
* When a message is received, the `receive` statement matches the message against the pattern `{Pid, Result}`. If the message matches the pattern, the `Result` variable is bound to the value of the message.
* The `io:fwrite` function is used to print the value of the `Result` variable to the console.

The `complex_function` function is a simple function that performs some complex calculations and then sends the result back to the main process using the `!` operator.

This code demonstrates how to use Erlang's concurrency features to perform complex calculations in parallel.
