Explanation:

1. Recursive Fibonacci Function (`recursive_fibonacci/1`):
   - This function calculates the Fibonacci numbers using a recursive approach.
   - The base case is defined for N less than 2, where the result is N itself.
   - For other values of N, the function calculates the sum of the two previous Fibonacci numbers.

2. Quicksort Algorithm Implementation (`quicksort/1`):
   - This function implements the quicksort algorithm to sort a list of numbers.
   - It selects a pivot element, partitions the list into two sublists, and recursively applies the algorithm to the sublists.
   - The result is a sorted list of numbers.

3. Binary Tree Insert Function (`binary_tree_insert/3`):
   - This function inserts a value into a binary tree, maintaining the binary search tree property.
   - It compares the value to the current node and decides whether to insert it in the left or right subtree.
   - The result is a balanced binary tree with the new value inserted in the appropriate position.

4. Example of Concurrency in Erlang (`concurrent_map/0`):
   - This function demonstrates how to use concurrency in Erlang using a simple map data structure.
   - It creates a separate process for handling map operations, allowing concurrent access to the map from different threads or processes.
   - The map_process function handles requests for getting and putting values in the map.

5. Map Get and Put Functions (`map_get/1` and `map_put/2`):
   - These functions are used to access and modify the map data structure from other processes or threads.
   - They communicate with the `map_process` to perform the necessary operations.

This code showcases various concepts in Erlang, including recursion, sorting algorithms, binary tree manipulation, and concurrency. It demonstrates the flexibility and versatility of Erlang for solving a wide range of problems.
