**Explanation:**

1. **Module Definition**: We start by defining a module named `complex_and_differentiated_code` using the `-module` directive. This module will encapsulate our code and make it accessible from other modules.


2. **Function Export**: We use the `-export` directive to specify which functions from this module should be visible outside the module. In this case, we export the `main` function, which will be the entry point for our program.


3. **Main Function**: The `main` function is the starting point of our program. It defines the main logic for calculating the sum of the elements in a binary tree.


4. **Binary Tree Data Structure**: We define a binary tree data structure using nested tuples. A binary tree consists of nodes, which can either be leaves (containing a single value) or internal nodes (containing two subtrees).


5. **SumTree Function**: We define a recursive function called `SumTree` to calculate the sum of the elements in a binary tree. The function takes a binary tree as an argument and returns the sum of all the elements in the tree.


6. **Calculating the Sum**: Inside the `SumTree` function, we use pattern matching to determine the type of node we're dealing with. If it's a leaf node, we simply return the value stored in the leaf. If it's an internal node, we recursively call `SumTree` on both the left and right subtrees and add the results together.


7. **Printing the Result**: Finally, we call the `main` function to start the program and calculate the sum of the elements in the binary tree. We use the `io:fwrite` function to print the result to the console.
