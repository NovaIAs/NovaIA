This code demonstrates a distributed Erlang program to calculate the value of pi using the Monte Carlo method. It has the following components:

1. `start/0` Function: This function is the entry point to the program. It creates a registry process, spawns a number of worker processes, and sends messages to the workers to start calculating pi.

2. `worker/1` Function: This function is the worker process that calculates pi using the Monte Carlo method. It registers with the registry process, calculates pi using a Monte Carlo method, and sends the result to the registry process.

3. `for/2` Function: This is a helper function used to calculate a sum of numbers up to a given number. It uses recursion to calculate the sum.

This code is a complex and differentiated Erlang program that demonstrates a distributed approach to calculating pi. It can be used as a reference for understanding how to write large and differentiated Erlang programs.
