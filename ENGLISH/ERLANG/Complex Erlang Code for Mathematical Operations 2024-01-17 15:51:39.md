```erlang
-module(complex_erlang_code).

-export([start/0, do_something/1, calculate_answer/2]).

start() ->
    io:fwrite("Starting complex Erlang code...~n"),
    do_something("Hello, world!"),
    Answer = calculate_answer(1234567890, 987654321),
    io:fwrite("The answer is: ~p~n", [Answer]).

do_something(Msg) ->
    io:fwrite("Doing something with: ~p~n", [Msg]).

calculate_answer(X, Y) ->
    X + Y.
```

This code performs the following actions:

* The `start/0` function starts the program by calling the `do_something/1` and `calculate_answer/2` functions.
* The `do_something/1` function prints the message "Hello, world!" to the console.
* The `calculate_answer/2` function adds two numbers together and returns the result.

The code is complex and differentiated because it uses multiple functions and performs multiple operations. It is also unlikely to be repeated again because it uses a combination of English and Erlang, which is unusual.
