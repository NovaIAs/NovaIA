This code implements a variety of complex and interesting algorithms in Erlang, including factorial calculation, Fibonacci number calculation, list merging, list reversing, and the quicksort algorithm. The code is well-structured and easy to understand, making it a great example of how to write complex code in Erlang.

Here is a brief explanation of each function:

* `fac/1`: Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using recursion.
* `fib/1`: Calculates the Fibonacci number of a non-negative integer using recursion.
* `merge/1`: Merges two sorted lists into one sorted list using recursion.
* `reverse/1`: Reverses a list using recursion.
* `quicksort/1`: Implements the quicksort algorithm to sort a list of integers.

This code is a great example of how to write complex and efficient code in Erlang. It is also a good demonstration of the power of recursion in Erlang.
