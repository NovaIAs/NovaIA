**Explanation:**

This Erlang code is a complex and differentiated program that performs a variety of calculations and displays the results. It includes the following features:

- **Factorial Calculation:** It defines a recursive function called `factorial` to calculate the factorial of a given number. It uses the recursive definition of factorial to compute the factorial of a number.

- **Prime Number Generation:** It defines a function called `generate_primes` to generate a list of prime numbers up to a given limit. It uses a sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently generate prime numbers.

- **Fibonacci Sequence Calculation:** It defines a function called `fibonacci` to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given limit. It uses a recursive approach to compute the Fibonacci sequence.

- **Displaying Results:** The code displays the results of the calculations, including the factorial of 10, a list of prime numbers up to 100, and the Fibonacci sequence up to 100.

This code showcases various programming techniques in Erlang, including recursion, list comprehensions, pattern matching, and I/O operations. It demonstrates the power and flexibility of Erlang for solving complex problems and performing mathematical calculations.
