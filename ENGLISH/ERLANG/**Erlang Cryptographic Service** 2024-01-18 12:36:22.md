```erlang
-module(crypto_service).
-export([start/0, encrypt/2, decrypt/2]).

start() ->
    register(crypto_service, self()),
    loop().

loop() ->
    receive
        {Pid, encrypt, Data} ->
            Pid ! {self(), encrypt, crypto:encrypt(Data)},
            loop();
        {Pid, decrypt, Data} ->
            Pid ! {self(), decrypt, crypto:decrypt(Data)},
            loop();
        _ ->
            loop()
    end.

encrypt(Data, Key) ->
    crypto_service ! {self(), encrypt, Data},
    receive
        {crypto_service, encrypt, EncryptedData} ->
            EncryptedData
    end.

decrypt(Data, Key) ->
    crypto_service ! {self(), decrypt, Data},
    receive
        {crypto_service, decrypt, DecryptedData} ->
            DecryptedData
    end.
```

1. First, the `crypto_service` module is defined, which will handle the encryption and decryption operations.
2. The `start/0` function is defined to start the crypto_service process. This function registers the process name `crypto_service` and calls the `loop/0` function to start the loop.
3. The `loop/0` function is a recursive function that handles incoming messages. It handles two types of messages:
    - `encrypt` messages: These messages contain data to be encrypted and a PID of the sender process. The function encrypts the data using the `crypto:encrypt/1` function and sends the encrypted data back to the sender process.
    - `decrypt` messages: These messages contain data to be decrypted and a PID of the sender process. The function decrypts the data using the `crypto:decrypt/1` function and sends the decrypted data back to the sender process.
4. The `encrypt/2` and `decrypt/2` functions are defined to provide an interface for other processes to use the encryption and decryption services. These functions send messages to the `crypto_service` process and wait for a response.

Overall, this code demonstrates the use of message passing in Erlang to implement a cryptographic service that can be used by other processes to encrypt and decrypt data.
