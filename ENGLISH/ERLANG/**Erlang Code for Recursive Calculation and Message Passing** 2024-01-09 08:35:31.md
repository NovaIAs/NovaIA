```

Explanation:

1. Module Definition:
   - `-module(complex_erlang_code).`: This defines the name of the Erlang module as `complex_erlang_code`.

2. Exported Function:
   - `-export([start/0]).`: This specifies that the `start/0` function is exported from this module, making it accessible from other modules.

3. `start/0` Function:
   - `start/0`: This is the entry point of the program. It starts the execution of the Erlang code.

4. Spawning a Process:
   - `Pid = spawn(fun() -> complex_function(1) end),`: This line creates a new process using the `spawn` function. The function to be executed in the new process is provided as an anonymous function (`fun() -> complex_function(1) end`). This function calls the `complex_function` with an initial argument of `1`.

5. Receiving a Message:
   - `receive`: This line starts a receive block, which waits for messages to be sent to the current process.

6. Pattern Matching:
   - `receive {Pid, Result} ->`: This pattern matches messages that are sent from the process with PID `Pid` and have the atom `Result` as the first element.

7. Outputting the Result:
   - `io:format("The result is: ~p~n", [Result])`: When a message matching the pattern is received, this line uses the `io:format` function to output the result to the console.

8. `complex_function` Function:
   - `complex_function(N)`: This is a recursive function that calculates a complex sequence of numbers based on the input `N`.

9. Recursive Function Logic:
   - The function uses an `if` expression to determine the next step based on the value of `N`:
     - If `N` is less than 10, it returns `N * 2`.
     - Otherwise, it calls itself recursively with `N - 1` and `N - 2` as arguments and adds the results together.

10. Process Exit:
    - The `Pid` process exits after completing the execution of the `complex_function`.

11. Receiving the Result:
    - The `start/0` function receives the message containing the result from the process with PID `Pid` and prints it to the console.

This code demonstrates advanced Erlang concepts such as process creation, message passing, and recursion, resulting in a complex and unique code structure.
