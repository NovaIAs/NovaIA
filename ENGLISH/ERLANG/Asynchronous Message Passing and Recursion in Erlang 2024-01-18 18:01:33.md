```erlang
-module(complex_erlang_code).

-export([start/0, loop/0]).

start() ->
    spawn(complex_erlang_code, loop, []).

loop() ->
    receive
        {From, Message} ->
            io:fwrite("Received message: ~p from ~p~n", [Message, From]),
            loop();
        _ ->
            io:fwrite("No message received. Terminating.~n"),
            exit(normal)
    end.
```

Explanation:

1. Module Definition:

```
-module(complex_erlang_code).
```

Defines a new Erlang module named "complex_erlang_code." Modules in Erlang are used to group related functions and data.

2. Exported Functions:

```
-export([start/0, loop/0]).
```

Specifies which functions in this module are exported and can be called from other modules. In this case, "start/0" and "loop/0" are exported.

3. start/0 Function:

```
start() ->
    spawn(complex_erlang_code, loop, []).
```

Defines a function named "start/0." It uses the "spawn" function to create a new Erlang process, which is a lightweight concurrent entity. The "spawn" function takes three arguments:

- The module name, which in this case is "complex_erlang_code."
- The function name, which is "loop."
- A list of arguments to be passed to the function, which is an empty list in this case.

4. loop/0 Function:

```
loop() ->
    receive
        {From, Message} ->
            io:fwrite("Received message: ~p from ~p~n", [Message, From]),
            loop();
        _ ->
            io:fwrite("No message received. Terminating.~n"),
            exit(normal)
    end.
```

Defines a function named "loop/0." This function uses the "receive" construct to wait for messages. When a message is received, it prints the message and the sender's PID using the "io:fwrite" function. Then, it calls itself recursively to continue waiting for messages.

If no message is received, it prints a message indicating that no message was received and then terminates the process with "exit(normal)."

5. Usage:

To use this code, you can start the "complex_erlang_code" module by calling the "start/0" function. This will create a new Erlang process that will continuously wait for messages. You can send messages to this process using the "Pid ! Message" syntax, where "Pid" is the PID of the process and "Message" is the message you want to send.

This code demonstrates the use of processes, message passing, and recursion in Erlang, which are fundamental concepts in Erlang programming.
