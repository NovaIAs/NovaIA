This Erlang code defines a complex application with a loop that handles different types of messages. Here's an explanation:

1. Module and Export:
   - The module name is `my_complex_app`.
   - The `-export` directive specifies that the `start/0` and `stop/0` functions are exported from this module.

2. `start/0` Function:
   - This function is called when the application is started.
   - It prints a message to indicate that the application is starting.
   - It registers the application process name (`my_complex_app`) with the Erlang runtime system.
   - It then calls the `loop/0` function to start the main loop of the application.

3. `stop/0` Function:
   - This function is called when the application is stopped.
   - It prints a message to indicate that the application is stopping.
   - It sends a `kill` message to the process registered as `my_complex_app`.

4. `loop/0` Function:
   - This function is the main loop of the application.
   - It uses the `receive` statement to wait for messages.
   - When a message is received, it matches the pattern and executes the corresponding code.

5. Message Handling:
   - The loop handles three types of messages:
     - `{get_data, Pid}`: This message requests data from the application. The application responds with a `{data, [1, 2, 3]}` message containing a list of numbers.
     - `{calculate, Data, Pid}`: This message requests the application to calculate the sum of a list of numbers. The application responds with a `{result, Result}` message containing the calculated result.
     - `stop`: This message is used to stop the application. When received, the loop exits with a normal exit status.

6. Registering the Application Process Name:
   - The `register(my_complex_app, self())` line registers the name `my_complex_app` with the current process. This allows other processes to communicate with this application process by sending messages to the registered name.

This code demonstrates a more complex Erlang application with a message loop and different types of message handling. The application can be started and stopped, and it can handle requests for data and calculation.
