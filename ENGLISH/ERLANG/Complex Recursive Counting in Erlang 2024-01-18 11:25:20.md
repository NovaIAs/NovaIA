```erlang
-module(complex_erlang_code).
-export([start/0, loop/1]).

start() ->
    loop(1).

loop(N) when N < 10000 ->
    io:fwrite("~p~n", [N]),
    loop(N+1);
loop(_) ->
    io:fwrite("Done~n").
```

Explanation:

1. **Module Definition:**
   - The code starts with the module definition `-module(complex_erlang_code).`. This line declares that the following code belongs to the `complex_erlang_code` module.

2. **Function Export:**
   - `-export([start/0, loop/1]).` exports two functions, `start/0` and `loop/1`, from the module, making them accessible outside the module.

3. **`start/0` Function:**
   - The `start/0` function is the entry point of the program. It simply calls the `loop/1` function with an initial value of 1.

4. **`loop/1` Function:**
   - The `loop/1` function is a recursive function that takes a parameter `N`. It prints the value of `N` using `io:fwrite/1` and then calls itself recursively with `N+1` until `N` reaches 10000.

5. **Recursive Loop:**
   - The recursive loop continues incrementing `N` and printing its value until it reaches 10000, at which point the function exits the loop and prints "Done" using `io:fwrite/1`.

6. **Use of `when` Guard:**
   - The `when N < 10000` guard ensures that the recursive call is only made if `N` is less than 10000. This prevents an infinite loop.

7. **Printing Output:**
   - The `io:fwrite/1` function is used to print the value of `N` and "Done" to the console.

When you run this code, you'll see a large number of integers printed to the console, counting from 1 to 9999, followed by "Done." This demonstrates a complex and recursive Erlang program that performs a simple counting task.
