Explanation:

1. **fibonacci/1**: This function calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the given number 'N'. It uses a recursive function 'fib' to calculate the sequence. The function takes three arguments: 'N', 'A' (the current Fibonacci number), and 'B' (the previous Fibonacci number). It starts with 'A' = 1 and 'B' = 0, and calculates the next Fibonacci number by adding 'A' and 'B'.

2. **factorial/1**: This function calculates the factorial of the given number 'N'. It uses a recursive function 'fact' to calculate the factorial. The function takes two arguments: 'N' and 'Acc' (the accumulator for multiplying numbers). It starts with 'Acc' = 1, and calculates the factorial by multiplying 'N' with 'Acc' and then calling the function recursively with 'N-1'.

3. **prime_factors/1**: This function finds the prime factors of the given number 'N'. It uses a recursive function 'prime_factors' to find the prime factors. The function takes three arguments: 'N', 'P' (the current prime number), and 'Acc' (the accumulator for storing the prime factors). It starts with 'P' = 2 and 'Acc' = [], and checks if 'N' is divisible by 'P'. If it is, it divides 'N' by 'P' and adds 'P' to 'Acc'. If it is not, it increments 'P' and calls the function recursively.

4. **reverse/1**: This function reverses the given list 'L'. It uses a recursive function 'reverse' to reverse the list. The function takes two arguments: 'L' (the list to be reversed) and 'Acc' (the accumulator for storing the reversed list). It starts with 'Acc' = [], and adds the first element of 'L' to 'Acc'. Then, it calls the function recursively with the tail of 'L' and the updated 'Acc'.

5. **merge_sort/1**: This function sorts the given list 'L' using the merge sort algorithm. It uses two recursive functions: 'merge_sort' to sort the list, and 'merge' to merge two sorted lists. The function 'merge_sort' takes two arguments: 'L' (the list to be sorted) and 'Acc' (the accumulator for storing the sorted list). It starts with 'Acc' = [], and calls the function 'split_list' to split 'L' into two halves. Then, it calls 'merge_sort' recursively on both halves, and merges the sorted halves using the 'merge' function. The function 'merge' takes three arguments: 'L1' (the first sorted list), 'L2' (the second sorted list), and 'Acc' (the accumulator for storing the merged list). It starts with 'Acc' = [], and compares the first elements of 'L1' and 'L2'. If the first element of 'L1' is less than or equal to the first element of 'L2', it adds the first element of 'L1' to 'Acc' and calls the function recursively with the tail of 'L1' and 'L2'. Otherwise, it adds the first element of 'L2' to 'Acc' and calls the function recursively with 'L1' and the tail of 'L2'.
