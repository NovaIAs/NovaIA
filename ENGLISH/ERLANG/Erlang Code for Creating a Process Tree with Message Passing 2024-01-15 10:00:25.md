This Erlang code creates a series of processes that communicate with each other using message passing. The code starts by defining a module called `complex_erlang_code` and exporting two functions: `start/0` and `do_something/1`.

The `start/0` function is used to start the process tree. It spawns a new process and calls the `do_something/1` function with an initial value of 1.

The `do_something/1` function is a recursive function that performs the following steps:

1. It checks if the value of `N` is greater than 100. If it is, it prints a message indicating that the end has been reached and exits the process.
2. If `N` is not greater than 100, it prints a message indicating that something is being done at the current value of `N`.
3. It spawns a new process and calls the `do_something/1` function with the value of `N` incremented by 1.
4. It receives a message from another process. This message is used to synchronize the processes and ensure that they do not progress too far ahead of each other.
5. After receiving the message, the function recursively calls itself with the value of `N` incremented by 1.

The result of this code is a series of processes that communicate with each other using message passing. The processes start at a value of 1 and increment their value by 1 until they reach a value of 100. At that point, the processes exit and the entire process tree terminates.
