Explanation:

1. The `-module` directive specifies the name of the module, which is `complex_code`.
2. The `-export` directive specifies which functions in this module are exported, so they can be called from other modules. In this case, the only exported function is `start/0`.
3. The `start/0` function is the entry point of the program. It defines the behavior of the agent and starts it.
4. The agent behavior is defined as a function that receives messages. When it receives a message, it prints the message and then calls itself recursively to wait for more messages. When it receives the `stop` message, it prints a message and terminates.
5. The `spawn` function is used to create a new process and start executing the agent behavior in it. The `Pid` variable contains the process identifier (PID) of the agent.
6. The `!` operator is used to send a message to a process. In this case, the `Pid` process is sent the message `{message, "Hello, agent!"}`.
7. The `receive` expression is used to wait for messages from other processes. In this case, the `Pid` process is waiting for the `stop` message.
8. When the `stop` message is received, the `Pid` process prints a message and terminates.
