```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'dart:convert';
import 'dart:async';

// Define a function to handle HTTP requests.
Future<void> handleHttpRequest(HttpRequest request, HttpResponse response) async {
  try {
    // Parse the request body as JSON.
    var requestBody = json.decode(await utf8.decodeStream(request));

    // Do something with the request body.
    var result = processRequestBody(requestBody);

    // Send the response back to the client.
    response.statusCode = HttpStatus.ok;
    response.headers.add('Content-Type', 'application/json');
    response.write(json.encode(result));
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle any errors that occur.
    response.statusCode = HttpStatus.internalServerError;
    response.write('An error occurred: $e');
  } finally {
    // Always close the response body.
    response.close();
  }
}

// Define a function to process the request body.
Map<String, dynamic> processRequestBody(Map<String, dynamic> requestBody) {
  // Do something with the request body.
  // In this example, we're just returning the request body.
  return requestBody;
}

// Create an HTTP server.
HttpServer.bind(InternetAddress.loopbackIPv4, 8080).then((server) {
  // Handle HTTP requests.
  server.listen(handleHttpRequest);
});
```

This code creates an HTTP server that listens on port 8080 and handles HTTP requests. When a request is received, the server parses the request body as JSON, processes the request body, and sends the response back to the client.

The code includes the following features:

* **Request parsing**: The server uses the `json` library to parse the request body as JSON. This allows the server to easily access the data in the request body.
* **Request processing**: The `processRequestBody` function is used to process the request body. In this example, the function simply returns the request body, but it could be used to perform any type of processing on the request body.
* **Response generation**: The server uses the `json` library to generate the response body as JSON. This allows the server to easily send data back to the client.
* **Error handling**: The `handleHttpRequest` function uses a `try-catch` block to handle any errors that occur during request processing. This ensures that the server can always send a response to the client, even if an error occurs.

This code is a good example of how to create a simple HTTP server in Dart. It can be used as a starting point for developing more complex applications.
