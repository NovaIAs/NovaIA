```dart
// Import the necessary libraries.
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:convert';
import 'dart:io';

// Define the main function.
void main() async {
  // Create a server socket.
  ServerSocket serverSocket = await ServerSocket.bind(InternetAddress.loopbackIPv4, 8080);

  // Listen for incoming connections.
  serverSocket.listen((Socket socket) async {
    // Read the request from the socket.
    HttpRequest request = await HttpRequest.receiveFromSocket(socket);

    // Parse the request body.
    String body = await request.transform(utf8.decoder).join();

    // Create a response object.
    HttpResponse response = request.response;

    // Set the response status code and body.
    response.statusCode = 200;
    response.write('Hello, world! You sent: $body');

    // Send the response to the client.
    response.close();

    // Close the socket.
    socket.close();
  });
}
```

This code creates a simple HTTP server in Dart. The server listens on port 8080 and responds to requests with a simple "Hello, world!" message.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
   - `dart:async`: for using asynchronous programming features.
   - `dart:convert`: for encoding and decoding data.
   - `dart:io`: for working with network sockets.

2. Define the main function:
   - This is the entry point of the program.

3. Create a server socket:
   - `ServerSocket.bind()` creates a server socket and binds it to the specified address and port.

4. Listen for incoming connections:
   - `ServerSocket.listen()` listens for incoming connections on the server socket. When a connection is accepted, a new `Socket` object is created.

5. Read the request from the socket:
   - `HttpRequest.receiveFromSocket()` reads the HTTP request from the socket and converts it into an `HttpRequest` object.

6. Parse the request body:
   - The request body is read from the `HttpRequest` object using `utf8.decoder`.

7. Create a response object:
   - An `HttpResponse` object is created to send the response back to the client.

8. Set the response status code and body:
   - The response status code is set to 200 (OK).
   - The response body is set to a simple "Hello, world!" message.

9. Send the response to the client:
   - `HttpResponse.close()` sends the response to the client and closes the response stream.

10. Close the socket:
    - `Socket.close()` closes the socket connection.

This code demonstrates how to create a basic HTTP server in Dart. It can be used as a starting point for building more complex web applications.
