Certainly! Here's a complex and unique Dart code that performs a recursive algorithm to calculate the nth Fibonacci number:

```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  // Prompt the user to enter the nth position
  stdout.write('Enter the position of the Fibonacci number: ');
  int n = int.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);

  // Calculate and print the Fibonacci number at the nth position
  int fibonacciNumber = calculateFibonacci(n);
  stdout.writeln('The Fibonacci number at position $n is $fibonacciNumber');
}

int calculateFibonacci(int n) {
  if (n <= 0) {
    return 0;
  } else if (n == 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return calculateFibonacci(n - 1) + calculateFibonacci(n - 2);
  }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The code starts by importing the `dart:io` library to allow input/output operations.
2. The `main()` function is defined as the entry point of the program.
3. The user is prompted to enter the position of the Fibonacci number to be calculated.
4. The `calculateFibonacci()` function is called with the user's input, and the result is stored in the `fibonacciNumber` variable.
5. Finally, the program prints the Fibonacci number at the given position.

The `calculateFibonacci()` function uses a recursive approach to calculate the Fibonacci number at position `n`. It follows these rules:
- If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns 0.
- If `n` is equal to 1, the function returns 1.
- Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself with `n - 1` and `n - 2`, and returns the sum of the two previous Fibonacci numbers.

This code demonstrates the power of recursion in solving problems and showcases the beauty of the Fibonacci sequence.
