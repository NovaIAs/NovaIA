```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  // Create a new directory.
  var directory = Directory('new_directory');
  directory.createSync();

  // Create a new file in the directory.
  var file = File('${directory.path}/new_file.txt');
  file.writeAsStringSync('Hello, world!');

  // Read the file's contents.
  var contents = file.readAsStringSync();

  // Print the file's contents to the console.
  print(contents);

  // Delete the file.
  file.deleteSync();

  // Delete the directory.
  directory.deleteSync();
}
