```dart
// Import the necessary libraries.
import 'dart:io';
import 'dart:math';

// Define the main function.
void main() {
  // Create a new File object.
  File file = new File('test.txt');

  // Open the file for writing.
  file.openWrite().then((RandomAccessFile file) {
    // Write some data to the file.
    file.writeString('Hello, world!');

    // Close the file.
    file.close();
  });

  // Read the data from the file.
  file.openRead().then((RandomAccessFile file) {
    // Read the data from the file.
    String data = file.readAsStringSync();

    // Print the data to the console.
    print(data);

    // Close the file.
    file.close();
  });
}
```

**Explanation:**

* The `import` statements at the beginning of the code import the necessary libraries.
* The `main` function is the entry point of the program.
* The `File` object is created using the `new` keyword.
* The `openWrite` method is called on the `File` object to open the file for writing.
* The `writeString` method is called on the `RandomAccessFile` object to write some data to the file.
* The `close` method is called on the `RandomAccessFile` object to close the file.
* The `openRead` method is called on the `File` object to open the file for reading.
* The `readAsStringSync` method is called on the `RandomAccessFile` object to read the data from the file.
* The `print` statement is used to print the data to the console.
* The `close` method is called on the `RandomAccessFile` object to close the file.

This code demonstrates how to create a file, write some data to it, read the data from it, and then close the file.
