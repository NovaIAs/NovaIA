// This is a complex and differentiated code in Dart that is unlikely to be repeated again.

// We define a class called `Complex` that will contain our complex number operations.
class Complex {
  // We define two fields to store the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.
  double real;
  double imaginary;

  // We define a constructor that takes two parameters, `real` and `imaginary`, and assigns them to the corresponding fields.

**Explanation:**

* We define a class called `Complex` that represents a complex number.
* The `Complex` class has two fields, `real` and `imaginary`, which store the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively.
* The `Complex` class has a constructor that takes two parameters, `real` and `imaginary`, and assigns them to the corresponding fields.
* The `Complex` class has several methods that perform various operations on complex numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, absolute value, argument, and conjugate.
* The `main` function creates two `Complex` objects, `c1` and `c2`, and performs some operations on them.
* The results of the operations are printed to the console.
