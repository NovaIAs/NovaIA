```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() async {
  // Create a directory.
  var directory = Directory('my_directory');
  try {
    await directory.create();
  } on FileSystemException catch (e) {
    if (e.osError == 17) {
      // Directory already exists.
      // Continue with the rest of the program.
    } else {
      throw e;
    }
  }

  // Create a file in the directory.
  var file = File('${directory.path}/my_file.txt');
  await file.writeAsString('Hello, world!');

  // Read the file.
  var contents = await file.readAsString();
  print(contents);

  // Delete the file.
  await file.delete();

  // Delete the directory.
  await directory.delete();
}
```

This code creates a directory named "my_directory", creates a file named "my_file.txt" in that directory, writes the string "Hello, world!" to the file, reads the contents of the file, deletes the file, and finally deletes the directory.

The code uses the `async` and `await` keywords to make the code asynchronous. This allows the code to run without blocking the main thread. The `async` keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function, and the `await` keyword is used to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete.

The `try` and `catch` statements are used to handle errors. The `try` statement contains the code that may throw an error, and the `catch` statement contains the code that will be executed if an error is thrown.

The `FileSystemException` class is used to represent errors that occur when working with the file system. The `osError` property of the `FileSystemException` class contains the operating system error code.

The `Directory` class is used to represent a directory in the file system. The `create()` method of the `Directory` class is used to create a new directory.

The `File` class is used to represent a file in the file system. The `writeAsString()` method of the `File` class is used to write a string to the file. The `readAsString()` method of the `File` class is used to read the contents of the file. The `delete()` method of the `File` class is used to delete the file.

The `print()` function is used to print the contents of the file to the console.
