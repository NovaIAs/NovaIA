Explanation:

1. The `FileUploadService` class provides a method for uploading a file to a specified URL.

2. The `generateFileName()` method generates a unique file name for the uploaded file using a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier).

3. The `uploadFile()` method takes a URL and a file path as parameters, and returns a `Future<String>` representing the response from the server.

4. Inside the `uploadFile()` method, a `MultipartRequest` is created. A multipart request is used for uploading files, and it consists of several parts, each containing a different piece of data.

5. The file is added to the request using the `MultipartFile` class. The `MultipartFile` constructor takes the following parameters:

   - `name`: The name of the file field in the multipart request.
   - `stream`: A stream of bytes representing the file contents.
   - `length`: The length of the file in bytes.
   - `filename`: The original file name.

6. The request is then sent to the server using the `send()` method, and the response is streamed back to the client.

7. The response body is converted to a string using the `bytesToString()` method.

8. The stringified response is returned as the result of the `uploadFile()` method.

9. In the `main()` function, an instance of the `FileUploadService` class is created, and the `uploadFile()` method is called to upload a file to a specified URL.

10. The response from the server is printed to the console.
