This code generates a random maze using a recursive backtracking algorithm. The maze is represented as a 2D list, where each element can be either a 0 (indicating an open space) or a 1 (indicating a wall).

The algorithm starts at the starting point and recursively explores all the possible paths through the maze. When it reaches a dead end, it backtracks and tries a different path. The algorithm continues until it reaches the ending point.

Once the maze is generated, it is printed to the console.

This code is complex because it uses a recursive algorithm and a lot of conditional statements to check for valid moves. It is also difficult to understand because the maze is represented as a 2D list, which can be difficult to visualize.

However, this code is also very powerful and can be used to generate mazes of any size or complexity. It is also a good example of how to use recursion to solve a problem.
