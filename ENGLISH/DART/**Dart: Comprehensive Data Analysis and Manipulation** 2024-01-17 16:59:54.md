This code is a complex and differentiated code in DART that will hardly be repeated again. The code performs a series of operations on a list of random numbers, including sorting the list, finding the minimum and maximum values, calculating the average value, creating a histogram of the numbers, finding the mode of the numbers, creating a new list of numbers that are greater than the average, creating a new list of numbers that are even, finding the first number in the list that is greater than 50, finding the last number in the list that is less than 50, finding the index of the first number in the list that is greater than 50, finding the index of the last number in the list that is less than 50, and grouping the numbers by their remainder when divided by 10.

The code uses a number of features of the Dart language, including generics, lambdas, and extension methods. It also uses a number of standard Dart libraries, including the 'dart:math' library and the 'dart:collection' library.

The code is well-commented and easy to read, making it a good example of how to write complex code in DART.
