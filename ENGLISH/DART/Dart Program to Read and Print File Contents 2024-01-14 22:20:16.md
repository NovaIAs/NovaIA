This is another multiline comment in Dart.

// Import the dart:io library for input and output.
import 'dart:io';

// Define the main function.
void main() {
  // Create a new File object for the file we want to read.
  var file = new File('data.txt');

  // Open the file for reading.
  file.openRead().then((RandomAccessFile file) {
    // Read the file contents into a string.
    file.readAsString().then((String contents) {
      // Print the file contents to the console.

This Dart program reads the contents of a file and prints them to the console.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The first line of the program is a multiline comment. Comments are used to explain what the code is doing. Multiline comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.
* The next two lines import the `dart:io` library. This library provides input and output functionality.
* The `main` function is the entry point for the program.
* The `File` object is used to represent a file on the file system. The `new` keyword is used to create a new `File` object.
* The `openRead()` method is used to open the file for reading.
* The `readAsString()` method is used to read the contents of the file into a string.
* The `then()` method is used to add a callback function that will be executed when the file is read.
* The callback function prints the contents of the file to the console.
* The `close()` method is used to close the file.
