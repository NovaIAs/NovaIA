Explanation:

1. **ComplexNumber Class**: We define a class called `ComplexNumber` to represent complex numbers. It has instance variables `real` and `imaginary` to store the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively.

2. **Constructor**: The constructor `ComplexNumber` initializes a complex number with specified real and imaginary parts.

3. **Arithmetic Operations**: We define methods for performing basic arithmetic operations on complex numbers, including `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. These methods take another `ComplexNumber` object as an argument and perform the respective operation on the real and imaginary parts.

4. **Absolute Value and Argument**: We also define methods `absoluteValue` and `argument` to calculate the absolute value (magnitude) and argument (angle) of a complex number, respectively.

5. **Equality Check**: The `equals` method checks if two complex numbers are equal by comparing their real and imaginary parts.

6. **String Representation**: The `toString` method converts a complex number to a string representation in the format `(real + imaginaryi)`, where `i` represents the imaginary unit.

7. **Example Usage**: In the `main` function, we create two complex numbers `c1` and `c2`, perform various operations on them, and print the results. We also calculate the absolute value and argument of `c1` and check if `c1` and `c2` are equal.

This code provides a comprehensive implementation of complex numbers in Dart, allowing you to perform various operations and calculations on them.
