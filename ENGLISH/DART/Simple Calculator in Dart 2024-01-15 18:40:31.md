This code is a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It can also calculate the square root and factorial of a number.

The code is written in Dart, which is a programming language that is similar to JavaScript. Dart is a compiled language, which means that it is converted into machine code before it is run. This makes it faster than JavaScript, which is an interpreted language.

The code is divided into several sections. The first section imports the dart:math library, which contains math functions. The second section defines the Calculator class, which contains the methods that the calculator can perform. The third section creates an instance of the Calculator class. The fourth section gets the user input. The fifth section performs the calculation. The sixth section prints the result.

The code is well-commented, which makes it easy to understand. The code is also well-structured, which makes it easy to maintain.
