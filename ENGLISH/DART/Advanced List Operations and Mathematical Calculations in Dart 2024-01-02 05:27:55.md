Certainly! Here's a complex and unique Dart code that demonstrates various advanced concepts and techniques:

```dart
import 'dart:math';

void main() {
  final List<int> numbers = [2, 5, 9, 3, 1, 8, 6, 7, 4];
  
  final sum = numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
  print('Sum of all numbers: $sum');
  
  final average = sum / numbers.length;
  print('Average of all numbers: $average');
  
  final sortedNumbers = numbers.toList()..sort();
  print('Sorted numbers: $sortedNumbers');
  
  final squares = numbers.map((num) => num * num).toList();
  print('Squares of all numbers: $squares');
  
  final evenNumbers = numbers.where((num) => num % 2 == 0).toList();
  print('Even numbers: $evenNumbers');
  
  final oddNumbers = numbers.where((num) => num % 2 != 0).toList();
  print('Odd numbers: $oddNumbers');
  
  final maxNumber = numbers.reduce(max);
  print('Maximum number: $maxNumber');
  
  final minNumber = numbers.reduce(min);
  print('Minimum number: $minNumber');
  
  final uniqueNumbers = numbers.toSet().toList();
  print('Unique numbers: $uniqueNumbers');
  
  final reversedNumbers = numbers.reversed.toList();
  print('Reversed numbers: $reversedNumbers');
  
  final factorial = numbers.fold(1, (prev, num) => prev * num);
  print('Factorial of all numbers: $factorial');
}
```

Explanation:
1. The code starts by creating a list of numbers `[2, 5, 9, 3, 1, 8, 6, 7, 4]`.
2. It then calculates the sum of all numbers using the `reduce` method of the list.
3. The average is calculated by dividing the sum by the length of the list.
4. The list is sorted in ascending order using the `sort` method.
5. Each number in the list is squared using the `map` method.
6. Even numbers are filtered using the `where` method with a condition that checks if the number is divisible by 2.
7. Odd numbers are filtered using the `where` method with a condition that checks if the number is not divisible by 2.
8. The maximum number in the list is found using the `reduce` method with the `max` function.
9. The minimum number in the list is found using the `reduce` method with the `min` function.
10. Duplicate numbers are removed by converting the list to a set and then converting it back to a list.
11. The numbers in the list are reversed using the `reversed` method.
12. The factorial of all numbers is calculated using the `fold` method, starting from 1 and multiplying each number.

This code demonstrates the usage of various Dart methods and functions, such as `reduce`, `map`, `where`, `sort`, `toList`, `reversed`, and `fold`. It showcases common list operations and mathematical calculations.
