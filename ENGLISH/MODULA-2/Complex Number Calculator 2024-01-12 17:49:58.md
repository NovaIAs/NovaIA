This code is a complex number calculator written in Modula-2. It defines a complex number type, and provides procedures to add, subtract, multiply, and divide complex numbers. It also includes a procedure to print a complex number.

The main program first prompts the user to enter two complex numbers. It then uses the procedures defined in the module to perform the four basic arithmetic operations on the two numbers, and prints the results.

Here is a brief explanation of the code:

- The `Complex` type defines a complex number with two fields, `real` and `imag`, to store the real and imaginary parts of the number, respectively.

- The `AddComplex`, `SubtractComplex`, `MultiplyComplex`, and `DivideComplex` procedures perform the four basic arithmetic operations on two complex numbers. They take two complex numbers as input parameters and return a complex number as the result.

- The `PrintComplex` procedure prints a complex number in the format "Real: <real part>, Imag: <imaginary part>".

- The main program first prompts the user to enter two complex numbers. It then uses the procedures defined in the module to perform the four basic arithmetic operations on the two numbers, and prints the results.
