This code is a Modula-2 program that compares two complex numbers and prints the result of the comparison.

The program first imports the necessary modules, including the `Terminal` module for input and output, and the `ComplexNumbers` module for complex number operations.

The `CompareComplex` procedure compares two complex numbers and returns a value of type `ComplexOrder`, which can be `Less`, `Equal`, or `Greater`.

The `PrintOrder` procedure prints the value of a `ComplexOrder` variable.

The main program prompts the user to enter two complex numbers, and then calls the `CompareComplex` procedure to compare them. The result of the comparison is then printed to the console.

Here is an example of the output of the program:

```
Enter the first complex number (a+bi): 3+4i
Enter the second complex number (c+di): 2+5i
The complex numbers are 3.00+4.00i and 2.00+5.00i in the order Less
```
