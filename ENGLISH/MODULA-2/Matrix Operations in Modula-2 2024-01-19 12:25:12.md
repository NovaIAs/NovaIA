This code performs matrix operations in Modula-2. It includes procedures for generating random matrices, printing matrices, multiplying matrices, and computing the exponentiation of a matrix raised to a given power.

The Main procedure generates three matrices: a, b, and c. It then multiplies a and b, storing the result in c, and prints the result. Finally, it computes the exponentiation of a raised to the power of 3 and prints the result.

The code is well-structured and uses clear variable names. The procedures are modular and easy to understand. The RandomMatrix procedure uses the Random and SetRandom procedures from the RandomNumbers module to generate random matrices. The PrintMatrix procedure uses the WriteString and WriteLn procedures from the Terminal module to print matrices to the console. The MultiplyMatrices procedure uses a triple nested loop to multiply two matrices and store the result in a third matrix. The MatrixExponentiation procedure uses a loop to repeatedly multiply a matrix by itself until the desired exponent is reached.

This code demonstrates the use of arrays, loops, and procedures in Modula-2. It also demonstrates the use of the RandomNumbers and Terminal modules.
