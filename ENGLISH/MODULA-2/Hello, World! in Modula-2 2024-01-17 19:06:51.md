This code is a simple program that asks the user for their name and then greets them by name. The program is written in Modula-2, a programming language that was developed in the 1970s and 1980s.

The program starts by importing the `WriteString` and `WriteLn` procedures from the `Terminal` module. These procedures are used to write text to the console.

The program then declares a variable named `Name` as an array of seven characters. This variable will be used to store the user's name.

The program then uses the `WriteString` procedure to write the text "What is your name?" to the console. The program then uses the `ReadString` procedure to read the user's name from the console and store it in the `Name` variable.

The program then uses the `WriteString` procedure to write the text "Hello, " to the console. The program then uses the `WriteString` procedure to write the value of the `Name` variable to the console.

Finally, the program uses the `WriteLn` procedure to write a newline character to the console. This causes the cursor to move to the next line.

The program then ends.
