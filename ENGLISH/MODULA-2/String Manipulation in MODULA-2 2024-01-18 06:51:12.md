The code you provided is a MODULA-2 program that demonstrates how to use the `Fmt` and `FmtStr` modules to manipulate strings.

The program starts by defining four string constants: `Str1`, `Str2`, `Str3`, and `Str4`. These strings contain different variations of the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

The program then defines a variable called `String` of type `FmtStr`. This variable will be used to store the formatted strings.

The program then calls the `Fmt` procedure to format the strings. The `Fmt` procedure takes two arguments: a string to be formatted and a list of values to be inserted into the string.

In the first call to `Fmt`, the program formats the string `Str1` by inserting the values "the" and "lazy" into the string. The resulting string is stored in the `String` variable.

In the second call to `Fmt`, the program formats the string `Str2` by inserting the value "fox" into the string. The resulting string is again stored in the `String` variable.

In the third call to `Fmt`, the program formats the string `Str3` by inserting the values "jumps" and "over" into the string. The resulting string is stored in the `String` variable.

In the fourth call to `Fmt`, the program formats the string `Str4` by inserting the value "the" into the string. The resulting string is stored in the `String` variable.

Finally, the program calls the `WriteString` and `WriteLn` procedures to output the formatted strings to the console.

The output of the program is as follows:

```
The lazy brown => fox =>> jumps over the dog.
The quick brown fox jumps over the dog.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The quick brown fox jumps over the dog.
```
