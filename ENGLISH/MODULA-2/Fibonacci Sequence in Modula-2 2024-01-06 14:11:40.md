This code implements the Fibonacci sequence in Modula-2. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 1 and 1.

The MODULE Fib; statement starts a new module called Fib.

The FROM FormatString IMPORT Fmt; statement imports the Fmt procedure from the FormatString module. This procedure is used to format and print strings.

The TYPE Sequence = ARRAY [0..255] OF CARDINAL; statement defines a new type called Sequence. This type is an array of 256 CARDINAL values.

The PROCEDURE Fibonacci(VAR Sequence: Sequence; VAR Count: CARDINAL); statement defines a new procedure called Fibonacci. This procedure takes two parameters: a Sequence array and a Count variable. The Sequence array will be filled with the Fibonacci numbers, and the Count variable will be set to the number of Fibonacci numbers that are generated.

The VAR i: CARDINAL; statement declares a local variable called i of type CARDINAL.

The WHILE x < MAXCARD DO statement starts a while loop that will continue until the value of x is greater than or equal to MAXCARD.

The BEGIN statement starts the body of the while loop.

The t := x + y; statement adds the values of x and y and stores the result in t.

The Sequence[Count] := t; statement stores the value of t in the Count-th element of the Sequence array.

The x := y; statement sets the value of x to the value of y.

The y := t; statement sets the value of y to the value of t.

The INC(Count); statement increments the value of Count by 1.

The END statement ends the body of the while loop.

The END Fibonacci; statement ends the Fibonacci procedure.

The PROCEDURE Show(Sequence: Sequence; Count: CARDINAL); statement defines a new procedure called Show. This procedure takes two parameters: a Sequence array and a Count variable. The Sequence array contains the Fibonacci numbers, and the Count variable specifies the number of Fibonacci numbers that are in the array.

The VAR i: CARDINAL; statement declares a local variable called i of type CARDINAL.

The BEGIN statement starts the body of the Show procedure.

The Fmt("Fibonacci numbers:"); statement uses the Fmt procedure to print the string "Fibonacci numbers:".

The WHILE i < Count DO statement starts a while loop that will continue until the value of i is greater than or equal to Count.

The BEGIN statement starts the body of the while loop.

The Fmt(" %u", Sequence[i]); statement uses the Fmt procedure to print the value of the i-th element of the Sequence array.

The INC(i) statement increments the value of i by 1.

The END statement ends the body of the while loop.

The Fmt(Newline) statement uses the Fmt procedure to print a newline character.

The END Show; statement ends the Show procedure.

The VAR Sequence: Sequence; statement declares a global variable called Sequence of type Sequence.

The VAR Count: CARDINAL; statement declares a global variable called Count of type CARDINAL.

The BEGIN statement starts the body of the Fib module.

The Fibonacci(Sequence, Count); statement calls the Fibonacci procedure to generate the Fibonacci numbers and store them in the Sequence array.

The Show(Sequence, Count); statement calls the Show procedure to print the Fibonacci numbers.

The END Fib. statement ends the Fib module.
