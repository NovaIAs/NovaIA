This code is a program that prints out the names and ages of the seven dwarfs from the fairy tale "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".

The program defines a record type called `Dwarf` that has three fields: `name`, `age`, and `birth_date`. It also defines an array of `Dwarf` records called `the_seven_dwarfs`.

The program then uses a `for` loop to iterate over the `the_seven_dwarfs` array and print out the name and age of each dwarf.

The `DwarfToString` function is used to convert a `Dwarf` record into a string that can be printed. The function uses the `IntegerToString` function from the `Sequence` module to convert the dwarf's age to a string. The function then uses an `if` statement to determine whether the dwarf is one year old or more than one year old. If the dwarf is one year old, the function returns a string that says "The dwarf " & d^.name & " is " & age_as_string & " year old." Otherwise, the function returns a string that says "The dwarf " & d^.name & " is " & age_as_string & " years old."

The program uses the `writeln` procedure from the `Terminal` module to print out the string returned by the `DwarfToString` function for each dwarf.
