Sure! Here's a complex MODULA-2 code that generates a random maze using the Prim's algorithm. The code utilizes a matrix to represent the maze and uses various procedures and functions for generating the maze, checking neighbors, and creating walls.

```
MODULE MazeGenerator;

TYPE
  Cell = RECORD
    visited: BOOLEAN;

      END;
    END;
  END;
END InitializeMaze;

    END;
    
    IF (neighborI >= 0) AND (neighborI < MAZE_SIZE) AND
       (neighborJ >= 0) AND (neighborJ < MAZE_SIZE) THEN
      neighborCell := maze[neighborI, neighborJ];
      IF NOT neighborCell.visited THEN

    ELSE
      stackTop := stackTop - 1;
      currentCell := stack[stackTop];
    END;
  UNTIL stackTop = 0;
END GenerateMaze;

PROCEDURE PrintMaze;

This code generates a random maze using the Prim's algorithm. The maze is represented by a matrix of cells, where each cell has a `visited` flag and a set of `walls`. The `walls` set represents the four sides of a cell, with values 0, 1, 2, and 3 representing the top, bottom, left, and right walls, respectively.

The `InitializeMaze` procedure initializes the maze by setting all cells as unvisited and with all walls intact. The `GetRandomCell` function picks a random unvisited cell from the maze. The `CheckNeighbors` procedure checks the neighbors of a given cell and removes the corresponding walls if they are unvisited.

The `GenerateMaze` procedure generates the maze by repeatedly picking a random unvisited cell, marking it as visited, and removing walls based on neighboring cells. It uses a stack to backtrack when necessary.

The `PrintMaze` procedure prints the generated maze by iterating over the cells and printing the corresponding walls.

Finally, the `MazeGenerator` module calls the `GenerateMaze` and `PrintMaze` procedures to generate and display the maze.
