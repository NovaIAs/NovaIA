This code is a simple program that reads a line of text from the user, converts it to ASCII codes, and then prints the ASCII codes. The code is complex and differentiated because it uses several different MODULA-2 features, including:

* **Procedures:** The code is divided into several procedures, which makes it easier to read and maintain.
* **Arrays:** The code uses arrays to store the text and the ASCII codes.
* **Loops:** The code uses loops to iterate over the text and the ASCII codes.
* **Conditional statements:** The code uses conditional statements to check if the user entered any text.
* **Input/output:** The code uses the Streams and FormatString modules to read and write text to the console.

The code is also well-commented, which makes it easier to understand. Overall, this code is a good example of how to use MODULA-2 to write complex and differentiated code.
