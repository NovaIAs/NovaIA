This program simulates a simple 3D game in which the player moves through a series of levels, defeating enemies as they go. The game is controlled using the WASD keys, and the player's goal is to reach the end of each level by moving to the right end of the screen.

The program begins by resetting the game, which sets the player's position to the starting point and creates an empty list of enemies. The main game loop then begins, which repeatedly draws the game, updates the game state, and checks for collisions between the player and the enemies.

The `DrawGame` procedure uses a series of `WriteString` and `WriteLn` calls to print the current game state to the console.

The `UpdateGame` procedure reads a key from the keyboard and updates the player's position accordingly. It also updates the positions of the enemies, and decrements their health if they are hit by the player.

The `CheckCollisions` procedure checks for collisions between the player and the enemies. If an enemy's health reaches 0, it is removed from the list of enemies. If the player reaches the end of the level, the level number is incremented and the game is reset.

The `Main` procedure initializes the game and then enters the main game loop. The loop continues until the user presses the escape key, at which point the program exits.
