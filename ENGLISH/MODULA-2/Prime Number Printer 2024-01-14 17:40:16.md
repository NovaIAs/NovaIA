This code is a program that prints the first n prime numbers.

The program first asks the user how many prime numbers they want to see. Then, it calls the PrintPrimes procedure to print the first n prime numbers.

The PrintPrimes procedure uses a loop to iterate through all the numbers from 1 to n. For each number, it calls the IsPrime procedure to check if the number is prime. If the number is prime, it is printed to the console.

The IsPrime procedure uses a loop to check if a number is prime. The loop iterates through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime. Otherwise, it is prime.

The program uses the TRUNC function to truncate the square root of the number to an integer. This is done to improve the efficiency of the program.

The program also uses the INC procedure to increment the value of a variable. This is done to simplify the code.

The program uses the WriteString procedure to print a string to the console. The WriteCard procedure is used to print a cardinal number to the console. The WriteLn procedure is used to print a newline character to the console.

The program uses the ReadCard procedure to read a cardinal number from the console.
