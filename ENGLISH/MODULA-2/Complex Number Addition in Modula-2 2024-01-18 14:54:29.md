This code defines a module called `ComplexCode` that contains the following:

- A type definition for a complex number, which has a real part and an imaginary part.
- A procedure called `AddComplexNumbers` that takes two complex numbers as input and returns their sum.
- A procedure called `PrintComplexNumber` that takes a complex number as input and prints it to the console.
- Three variables of type `ComplexNumber` called `a`, `b`, and `c`.

The main part of the code begins by assigning values to the real and imaginary parts of `a` and `b`. Then, it calls the `AddComplexNumbers` procedure to add `a` and `b` together and stores the result in `c`.

Next, the code uses the `WriteString` and `WriteLn` procedures from the `Terminal` module to print the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` to the console.

The output of the program is:

```
The sum of 3.00 + 4.00i and 5.00 + 6.00i is 8.00 + 10.00i
```
