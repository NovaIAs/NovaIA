Explanation:

1. `MODULE ComplicatedModula2Code`: This line declares the start of the module named `ComplicatedModula2Code`. Modules are used to group related procedures and data types together.

2. `FROM` statements: These statements import various libraries into the module. Libraries provide pre-defined procedures and data types that can be used in your program.

3. `TYPE Noodle`: This line defines a new data type named `Noodle`. It is an array of characters of size 10. This type will be used to represent a single bowl of noodles.

4. `TYPE Meal`: This line defines another data type named `Meal`. It is an array of `Noodle` arrays of size 10. This type will be used to represent a complete meal, which consists of multiple bowls of noodles.

5. `PROCEDURE ServeMeal`: This procedure displays the contents of a `Meal` array on the screen. It iterates through each `Noodle` array in the `Meal` and prints the characters in each bowl of noodles.

6. `PROCEDURE MakeMeal`: This procedure prompts the user to enter the contents of a `Meal` array. It iterates through each `Noodle` array in the `Meal` and reads a string from the user for each bowl of noodles.

7. `VAR menu: Meal;`: This line declares a variable named `menu` of type `Meal`. This variable will be used to store the complete meal.

8. `BEGIN`: This line marks the start of the main program.

9. `MakeMeal(menu);`: This line calls the `MakeMeal` procedure to allow the user to enter the contents of the meal.

10. `ServeMeal(menu);`: This line calls the `ServeMeal` procedure to display the contents of the meal on the screen.

11. `END ComplicatedModula2Code;`: This line marks the end of the module.

This program demonstrates basic data structures, input and output operations, and procedure calls in Modula-2. It is a more complicated code that involves creating and manipulating custom data types and using multiple procedures to perform specific tasks.
