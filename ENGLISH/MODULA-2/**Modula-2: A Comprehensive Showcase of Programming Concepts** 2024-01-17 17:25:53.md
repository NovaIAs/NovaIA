Explanation:

1. **EnumTest:** Demonstrates the use of enumerated types by defining a `Color` type with various colors and printing them using a loop.

2. **RangeTest:** Illustrates the use of ranges by defining a range from 1 to 100 and printing the numbers in the range using a loop.

3. **StringTest:** Shows how to define and manipulate strings by assigning a string to a variable and printing it.

4. **ArrayTest:** Demonstrates the use of arrays by defining an array of integers, filling it with values, and printing the values using a loop.

5. **SetTest:** Illustrates the use of sets by defining a set of characters and printing the characters in the set.

6. **RecordTest:** Demonstrates the use of records by defining a `Person` record type with fields for name and age, assigning values to the fields, and printing them.

7. **ProcedureTest:** Shows how to define and call procedures by defining a procedure to print a message and calling it from the main program.

8. **ModuleTest:** Demonstrates the use of modules by defining a nested module with a procedure and calling the procedure from the main program.

This code covers various Modula-2 features and concepts, making it a comprehensive and complex example of Modula-2 programming. It showcases the use of enumerated types, ranges, strings, arrays, sets, records, procedures, and modules in a single program. The code is well-commented and provides a detailed explanation of each section, making it easier to understand and modify.
