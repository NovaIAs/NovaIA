This code performs various matrix operations, including addition, multiplication, and inversion. It includes detailed comments and explanations for each part of the code. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Matrix Type**:

   - `TYPE Matrix = ARRAY[INTEGER] OF INTEGER;`: This defines a custom type called `Matrix` representing a two-dimensional matrix of integers.

2. **Procedure `PrintMatrix`**:

   - This procedure prints a matrix to the console. It iterates through the rows and columns of the matrix and prints each element with a space separator.

3. **Procedure `AddMatrices`**:

   - This procedure adds two matrices of the same dimensions. It iterates through the rows and columns of the matrices, adding corresponding elements together and returning the resulting matrix.

4. **Procedure `MultiplyMatrices`**:

   - This procedure multiplies two matrices. It uses nested loops to calculate the dot product of each row of the first matrix with each column of the second matrix, resulting in the product matrix.

5. **Procedure `InvertMatrix`**:

   - This procedure inverts a square matrix. It uses Gaussian elimination to transform the matrix into an identity matrix, and the resulting matrix is the inverse.

6. **Main Program**:

   - The main program defines two example matrices `m1` and `m2`. It then calls the procedures `PrintMatrix`, `AddMatrices`, `MultiplyMatrices`, and `InvertMatrix` to perform various operations on the matrices and print the results to the console.

This code demonstrates various matrix operations in Modula-2 and includes detailed explanations for each part of the code, making it a comprehensive and educational example.
