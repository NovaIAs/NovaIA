This code is a complex and differentiated program in MODULA-2, which is a programming language designed for the development of reliable and efficient software. The program is a simple database manager that allows the user to add, print, search, delete, and edit records.

The program consists of several modules, each of which performs a specific task. The main module, ComplexCode, contains the main program logic and calls the other modules to perform the various tasks.

The InitializeDatabase module initializes the database by creating an array of 100 records and setting all of the fields in each record to empty strings.

The AddRecord module adds a new record to the database. It takes the name, age, and address of the person as input and stores them in the next available record in the database.

The PrintRecord module prints a single record to the console. It takes the index of the record to be printed as input and prints the name, age, and address of the person stored in that record.

The PrintAllRecords module prints all of the records in the database to the console. It iterates through the array of records and calls the PrintRecord module to print each record.

The SearchRecord module searches the database for a record with a given name. It takes the name of the person to be searched for as input and searches through the database until it finds a record with that name. If a record is found, it calls the PrintRecord module to print the record to the console.

The DeleteRecord module deletes a record from the database. It takes the index of the record to be deleted as input and deletes the record from the array of records.

The EditRecord module edits a record in the database. It takes the index of the record to be edited as input and allows the user to change the name, age, or address of the person stored in that record.

The ShowMenu module displays a menu of options to the user. The user can choose to add a record, print all records, search for a record, delete a record, edit a record, or exit the program.

The GetChoice module gets the user's choice from the menu. It repeatedly displays the menu and prompts the user to enter their choice until they enter a valid choice.

The Main module is the entry point of the program. It calls the InitializeDatabase module to initialize the database and then repeatedly calls the ShowMenu and GetChoice modules to get the user's choice and perform the appropriate action.

This program demonstrates the use of several MODULA-2 features, including modules, arrays, records, and procedures. It is a complex and differentiated program that shows how MODULA-2 can be used to create real-world applications.
