Explanation:

- The code defines a module named ComplexCode.
- It imports the WriteString procedure from the Terminal module to print strings to the console.
- It defines a procedure named WriteComplex that takes a string as an argument and prints it using the WriteString procedure.
- It defines a procedure named UseProcedure that takes a reference to a procedure as an argument and calls that procedure.
- It declares a variable p of type reference, which is a pointer to a procedure that takes a string as an argument.
- It defines two additional procedures, WriteComplex2 and WriteComplex3, that print strings to the console.
- It assigns the WriteComplex procedure to the p variable.
- It calls p with the string "hello" as an argument, which prints "hello" to the console.
- It changes the value of p to point to the WriteComplex2 procedure.
- It calls p with the string "world" as an argument, which prints "world" to the console.
- It calls UseProcedure with the WriteComplex3 procedure as an argument, which calls WriteComplex3 and prints "world" to the console.
