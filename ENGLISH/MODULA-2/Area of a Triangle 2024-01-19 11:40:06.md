The code computes the area of a triangle using the formula A = (BH)/2. It prompts the user to enter the height and the base of the triangle, and then calculates the area. Finally, it prints the area of the triangle to the standard output.

The code is structured in a modular way, with the main logic contained in the module Area_Of_Triangle. The module FormatString provides the function WriteString, which is used to print text to the standard output. The module Terminal provides the function ReadLongInt, which is used to read a long integer from the standard input.

The code uses the variable TriangleHeight to store the height of the triangle, the variable TriangleBase to store the base of the triangle, and the variable Area to store the area of the triangle. The variable Area is initialized to 0 before the calculation of the area begins.

The code uses the operator / to perform integer division. The operator * is used to perform integer multiplication. The operator := is used to assign a value to a variable.

The code uses the function WriteLongInt to print the area of the triangle to the standard output. The function WriteString is used to print text to the standard output.

The code is commented to make it easier to understand. The comments are enclosed in curly braces ({ and }).

The code is indented to make it easier to read. The indentation is done using spaces.

The code is written in MODULA-2, which is a high-level programming language developed in the 1970s. MODULA-2 is a strongly typed language with a modular structure. It is known for its clarity, simplicity, and reliability.
