Explanation:

This MODULA-2 program is a simple document processing program that reads a text file specified by the user, processes the document to count the number of words, lines, and characters, and then writes the results to an output file specified by the user.

The program first prompts the user to enter the input and output file names. It then opens the input file in text mode and the output file also in text mode.

Next, the program calls the `ReadDocument` procedure to read the document from the input file into an array of characters. The `ReadDocument` procedure reads each line of the document from the input file and stores it in the array of characters. When the `ReadDocument` procedure encounters an empty line, it terminates the loop and returns.

After the document has been read, the program calls the `ProcessDocument` procedure to process the document. The `ProcessDocument` procedure counts the number of words, lines, and characters in the document. It does this by iterating through the array of characters and counting the number of spaces, newlines, and characters.

Finally, the program writes the results of the processing to the output file. It does this by opening the output file in text mode, writing the word count, line count, and character count to the file, and then closing the file.

This program is a good example of how to use MODULA-2 to perform simple text processing tasks.
