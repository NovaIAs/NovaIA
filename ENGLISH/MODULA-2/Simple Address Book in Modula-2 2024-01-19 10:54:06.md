This code is a program that allows the user to enter and store information about 10 people. It uses an array of records to store the information, and it includes procedures to read and display the data. The program is quite simple, but it demonstrates a number of important Modula-2 concepts, including:

* **Modules:** The program is divided into two modules: `ComplexCode` and `Terminal`. The `Terminal` module contains procedures for reading and writing to the console, and the `ComplexCode` module contains the main program logic.
* **Data types:** The program uses a number of different data types, including `CARDINAL`, `STRING`, and `ARRAY`.
* **Procedures:** The program contains several procedures, including `WritePerson`, `ReadPerson`, `DisplayPeople`, and `Main`.
* **Loops:** The program uses a `FOR` loop to read and display the data about the people.

The program works as follows:

1. The `Main` procedure calls the `ReadPerson` procedure 10 times to read information about 10 people from the user.
2. The `ReadPerson` procedure prompts the user to enter the name and age of a person, and then it stores the information in an array of records.
3. After the user has entered information about all 10 people, the `Main` procedure calls the `DisplayPeople` procedure to display the information on the console.
4. The `DisplayPeople` procedure uses a `FOR` loop to iterate over the array of records and call the `WritePerson` procedure to display each person's name and age.

The program is a good example of how Modula-2 can be used to write clear, concise, and efficient programs.
