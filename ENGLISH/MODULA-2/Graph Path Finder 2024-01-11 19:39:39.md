Explanation:

The code is a program that finds all paths in a graph.
It uses a recursive function FindPaths to find all paths from a given starting vertex to all other vertices in the graph.
The function takes as input a vertex v and returns a list of all paths from v to all other vertices in the graph.
The function first checks if the current vertex v is the last vertex in the graph, in which case it prints the current path.
Otherwise, it iterates over all vertices s in the graph and checks if there is an edge from v to s.
If there is an edge, it adds s to the current path and calls the function recursively with s as the new starting vertex.
After the recursive call, it removes s from the current path.

The main function creates a graph with 4 vertices and 5 edges, and then calls the FindPaths function to find all paths from vertex 0 to all other vertices in the graph.
The paths are then printed to the console.
