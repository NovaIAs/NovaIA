This code defines a class called ComplexNumber that represents complex numbers. It has two instance variables, real and imaginary, which store the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively.

The class has a number of methods, including:

* `initialize:`: This method initializes a new complex number with the given real and imaginary parts.
* `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`: These methods define the basic arithmetic operations for complex numbers.
* `abs`: This method returns the absolute value of the complex number.
* `arg`: This method returns the argument of the complex number.
* `conjugate`: This method returns the complex conjugate of the complex number.
* `real` and `imaginary`: These methods return the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively.
* `printOn:`: This method prints the complex number in the form "a + bi".

To use this class, you can create a new complex number like this:

```smalltalk
aComplexNumber := ComplexNumber new real: 3.0 imaginary: 4.0.
```

You can then use the methods of the class to perform operations on the complex number. For example, to add two complex numbers, you can use the `+` method:

```smalltalk
anotherComplexNumber := ComplexNumber new real: 5.0 imaginary: 6.0.
sum := aComplexNumber + anotherComplexNumber.
```

The sum variable will now contain a new complex number that is the sum of the two complex numbers.

You can also use the `printOn:` method to print the complex number to the console:

```smalltalk
aComplexNumber printOn: Transcript.
```

This will print the complex number in the form "a + bi" to the console.
