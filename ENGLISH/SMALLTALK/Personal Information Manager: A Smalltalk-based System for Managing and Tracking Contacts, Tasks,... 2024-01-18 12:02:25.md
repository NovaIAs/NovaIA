System Definition:
A Smalltalk-based system for managing and tracking personal information, including contacts, tasks, appointments, and notes. The system should be easy to use and allow users to efficiently organize and retrieve their information.

Classes and Objects:
- Contact: Represents a person or organization with name, address, phone numbers, and email addresses.
- Task: Represents a task or activity to be completed, including title, description, due date, and priority.

Data Persistence:

- Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): The system uses an ORM library to map objects to database tables and automatically handle data persistence.

Search and Filtering:

Notifications:
- Reminders: The system can send reminders for appointments and tasks, either as pop-up notifications or email alerts.
- Synchronization: The system can synchronize data with a remote server, allowing users to access their information from multiple devices.

Reporting:
- Reports: The system provides a reporting module that allows users to generate reports based on their data, such as a list of overdue tasks or a summary of appointments for a specific month.

User Management:
- User Accounts: The system supports multiple user accounts, allowing different users to have separate data and settings.
- Access Control: The system implements access control mechanisms to restrict user access to specific data or features, based on their roles or permissions.

Extensibility:
