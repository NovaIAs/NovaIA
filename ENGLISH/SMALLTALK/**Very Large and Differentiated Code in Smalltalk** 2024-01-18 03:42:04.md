Explanation:

* The `VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode` class is defined as a subclass of `Object`.
* The class has three instance variables: `x`, `y`, and `z`.
* The class has a factory method, `new`, which creates a new instance of the class with the given values for `x`, `y`, and `z`.
* The instance methods include accessor methods for `x`, `y`, and `z`, as well as a `toString` method that returns a string representation of the object.
* The example usage at the bottom of the code creates a new instance of the `VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode` class with `x = 1`, `y = 2`, and `z = 3`. It then calls the accessor methods and the `toString` method to display information about the object.
