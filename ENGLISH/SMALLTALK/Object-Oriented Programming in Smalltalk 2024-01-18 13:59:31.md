Explanation:

1. We define four classes: Wizard, Magician, Spell, and BookOfSpells.
2. Each class has instance variables and an initializer method.
3. The initializer methods are used to initialize the instance variables of the objects.
4. We create an instance of the Wizard class, initialize its wand, and assign it to the variable "wizard".
5. We create an instance of the Magician class, initialize its hat, and assign it to the variable "magician".
6. We create an instance of the Spell class, initialize its name and incantation, and assign it to the variable "spell".
7. We create an instance of the Wand class, initialize its length and type, and assign it to the variable "wand".
8. We create an instance of the Hat class, initialize its size and color, and assign it to the variable "hat".
9. We create an instance of the BookOfSpells class, initialize its spells with a collection of spells, and assign it to the variable "bookOfSpells".
