This is an example of a very large and differentiated code in Smalltalk. It is a module to manage user accounts in a Smalltalk application. The code includes classes to represent a user account and a user account manager, as well as methods to add, remove, and validate user accounts. The code also includes a method to connect to a database to validate user credentials against a database.
