```smalltalk
Object subclass: #Person
    instanceVariables: 'name age gender'

    classMethods: [
        :newWithName: aName withAge: anAge withGender: aGender |
            ^ self new name: aName; age: anAge; gender: aGender
    ]
```

This code defines a class called `Person` in Smalltalk. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. `Object subclass: #Person`: This line declares that `Person` is a subclass of the `Object` class, which is the base class for all objects in Smalltalk. It essentially creates a new class named `Person`.

2. `instanceVariables: 'name age gender'`: This line defines the instance variables for the `Person` class. Instance variables are attributes that belong to each instance or object of the class. In this case, each `Person` object will have three instance variables: `name`, `age`, and `gender`.

3. `classMethods:`: This keyword introduces the class methods for the `Person` class. Class methods are methods that can be called directly on the class itself, rather than on an instance of the class.

4. `:newWithName: aName withAge: anAge withGender: aGender |`: This line defines a class method named `newWithName:withAge:withGender:`. This method allows you to create a new `Person` object with the specified name, age, and gender.

5. `^ self new name: aName; age: anAge; gender: aGender`: The `^` symbol is used to specify the result of the method. In this case, the method will return a new `Person` object created by calling the `new` method on the `Person` class, passing in the provided name, age, and gender values as arguments.

This code defines a class structure for representing person objects with `name`, `age`, and `gender` attributes, and provides a class method to easily create new `Person` objects with specified values.
