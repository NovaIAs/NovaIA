"Create instances of each class"

c := Cat new.
d := Dog new.
l := Lion new.
t := Tree new.
f := Flower new.
s := Student new.
tch := Teacher new.
doc := Doctor new.

"Send messages to the instances"

c greet.
d bark.

Explanation:

1. The code defines a class hierarchy with seven classes: Object, Animal, Plant, Person, Cat, Dog, Lion, Tree, Flower, Student, Teacher, and Doctor.

2. Each class has its own behavior, defined by methods. For example, the Cat class has a meow method that prints "Meow!" when called.

3. Instances of each class are created and messages are sent to them to invoke their behavior. For example, the following code sends the meow message to the instance c of the Cat class:

```smalltalk
c meow.
```

4. The output of the code is:

```
Hello, world!
Meow!
Woof!
Roar!
The plant is growing.
The flower is blooming.
The student is studying.
The teacher is teaching.
The doctor is healing.
