```smalltalk
[ [ [ "Error" ] notifyUser ]
ifTrue: [ [ "Cancel" ] confirm ]
ifFalse: [ "Something went wrong"
informUser ] ]
```

Explanation:

1. `[ "Error" ] notifyUser`: This line of code displays a notification to the user with the message "Error". The `notifyUser` method is used to display a notification to the user, and it takes a string argument, which in this case is "Error".

2. `ifTrue: [ [ "Cancel" ] confirm ]`: This line of code checks if the result of the previous line of code (i.e., the notification) was `true`. If it was, it displays a confirmation dialog to the user with the message "Cancel". The `confirm` method is used to display a confirmation dialog to the user, and it takes a string argument, which in this case is "Cancel".

3. `ifFalse: [ "Something went wrong" informUser ]`: This line of code checks if the result of the previous line of code (i.e., the confirmation dialog) was `false`. If it was, it displays an information dialog to the user with the message "Something went wrong". The `informUser` method is used to display an information dialog to the user, and it takes a string argument, which in this case is "Something went wrong".
