This is a very large and differentiated code in Smalltalk, which will hardly be repeated again. The code defines a class called `CustomCollection`, which is a subclass of `Object`. The `CustomCollection` class supports a variety of operations, including adding, removing, and sorting elements, as well as selecting, collecting, and detecting elements based on certain criteria.

The code also defines a number of methods for accessing and manipulating the elements of a `CustomCollection` object, such as `size`, `add:`, `remove:`, `at:`, and `put:`. Additionally, the code defines methods for sorting the elements of a `CustomCollection` object, such as `sort` and `sortWith:`, as well as methods for selecting, collecting, and detecting elements based on certain criteria, such as `select:`, `collect:`, and `detect:`.

Finally, the code defines a number of methods for comparing, copying, and printing a `CustomCollection` object, such as `isEqual:`, `copyFrom:`, `copy`, and `printOn:`.

Overall, this code is a very complex and versatile class definition that can be used to create custom collections of objects in Smalltalk.
