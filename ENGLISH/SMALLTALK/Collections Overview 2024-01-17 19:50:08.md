Object subclass: Collection [
    "An abstract collection is a group of objects treated as a single, unified object. Collections are often used to hold a group of related objects. Collections typically support common operations for adding and removing objects, finding objects, and iterating over the objects in the collection.
    
    The abstract collection class provides a common interface for all collections, and defines some basic methods for manipulating collections. This class is not intended to be instantiated directly, but rather to be subclassed to create specific types of collections.
    
    For example, the Array class is a subclass of Collection. Arrays are ordered collections of objects, and they support methods for adding and removing objects, finding objects, and iterating over the objects in the array.
    
    The Set class is another subclass of Collection. Sets are unordered collections of objects, and they support methods for adding and removing objects, finding objects, and iterating over the objects in the set.
    
    The Bag class is a third subclass of Collection. Bags are unordered collections of objects that allow duplicates. Bags support methods for adding and removing objects, finding objects, and iterating over the objects in the bag.

    The Dictionary class is a fourth subclass of Collection. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. Dictionaries support methods for adding and removing key-value pairs, finding key-value pairs, and iterating over the key-value pairs in the dictionary.
    
    The abstract collection class provides a common interface for all of these different types of collections. This allows you to write code that works with any type of collection, without having to worry about the specific implementation of the collection.
    
    The following are some of the most common methods defined by the abstract collection class:
    
    * **add:** Adds an object to the collection.
    
    * **remove:** Removes an object from the collection.
    
    * **find:** Finds an object in the collection.
    
    * **iterate:** Iterates over the objects in the collection.
    
    * **size:** Returns the number of objects in the collection.
    
    * **isEmpty:** Returns true if the collection is empty, false otherwise.
    
    * **contains:** Returns true if the collection contains the specified object, false otherwise.
    
    * **isEqual:** Compares the collection to another collection and returns true if they are equal, false otherwise.
    
    * **hash:** Returns a hash code for the collection.
    
    * **print:** Prints the collection to the console.
    
    The abstract collection class also defines a number of other methods that are used for more advanced operations on collections. These methods are not covered in this document.

Collection subclass: Array [
    "An array is an ordered collection of objects. Arrays are often used to hold a group of related objects that need to be accessed in a specific order.
    
    For example, an array could be used to hold the names of the students in a class, or the prices of the items in a shopping cart.
    
    Arrays support the following operations:
    
    * **add:** Adds an object to the end of the array.
    
    * **remove:** Removes an object from the array.
    
    * **find:** Finds an object in the array.
    
    * **iterate:** Iterates over the objects in the array.
    
    * **size:** Returns the number of objects in the array.
    
    * **isEmpty:** Returns true if the array is empty, false otherwise.
    
    * **contains:** Returns true if the array contains the specified object, false otherwise.
    
    * **isEqual:** Compares the array to another array and returns true if they are equal, false otherwise.
    
    * **hash:** Returns a hash code for the array.
    
    * **print:** Prints the array to the console.
    
    Arrays are implemented using a contiguous block of memory. This makes them very efficient for accessing objects in a specific order. However, it also means that adding or removing objects from the middle of an array can be expensive.
    
    For more information on arrays, see the Smalltalk documentation."

Collection subclass: Set [
    "A set is an unordered collection of objects. Sets are often used to hold a group of related objects that do not need to be accessed in a specific order.
    
    For example, a set could be used to hold the names of the students in a class, or the colors of the cars in a parking lot.
    
    Sets support the following operations:
    
    * **add:** Adds an object to the set.
    
    * **remove:** Removes an object from the set.
    
    * **find:** Finds an object in the set.
    
    * **iterate:** Iterates over the objects in the set.
    
    * **size:** Returns the number of objects in the set.
    
    * **isEmpty:** Returns true if the set is empty, false otherwise.
    
    * **contains:** Returns true if the set contains the specified object, false otherwise.
    
    * **isEqual:** Compares the set to another set and returns true if they are equal, false otherwise.
    
    * **hash:** Returns a hash code for the set.
    
    * **print:** Prints the set to the console.
   
    Sets are implemented using a hash table. This makes them very efficient for adding, removing, and finding objects. However, it also means that the order of the objects in a set is not guaranteed.
    
    For more information on sets, see the Smalltalk documentation."

Collection subclass: Bag [
    "A bag is an unordered collection of objects that allows duplicates. Bags are often used to hold a group of related objects that do not need to be accessed in a specific order and that may contain duplicates.
    
    For example, a bag could be used to hold the names of the students in a class, or the colors of the cars in a parking lot, even if some students have the same name or some cars have the same color.
    
    Bags support the following operations:
    
    * **add:** Adds an object to the bag.
    
    * **remove:** Removes an object from the bag.
    
    * **find:** Finds an object in the bag.
    
    * **iterate:** Iterates over the objects in the bag.
    
    * **size:** Returns the number of objects in the bag.
    
    * **isEmpty:** Returns true if the bag is empty, false otherwise.
    
    * **contains:** Returns true if the bag contains the specified object, false otherwise.
    
    * **isEqual:** Compares the bag to another bag and returns true if they are equal, false otherwise.
    
    * **hash:** Returns a hash code for the bag.
    
    * **print:** Prints the bag to the console.
    
    Bags are implemented using a hash table. This makes them very efficient for adding, removing, and finding objects. However, it also means that the order of the objects in a bag is not guaranteed.
    
    For more information on bags, see the Smalltalk documentation."

Collection subclass: Dictionary [
    "A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are often used to hold a group of related objects that are accessed by a key.
    
    For example, a dictionary could be used to hold the names and addresses of the students in a class, or the prices and descriptions of the items in a store.
    
    Dictionaries support the following operations:
    
    * **add:** Adds a key
