Usage:

```smalltalk
(Issue new) summary: 'Fix login page'.
(FeatureRequest new) summary: 'Add new feature X' benefit: 10 cost: 5 risk: 2.
(BugFix new) summary: 'Fix bug Y' severity: 'High' reproducibility: 'Always'.
(NewFeature new) summary: 'Add new feature Z' value: 15 complexity: 10.
(Refactoring new) summary: 'Refactor code' impact: 'High' difficulty: 'Medium'.
(Task new) summary: 'Write documentation' workload: 5.
```

Explanation:

This code creates six instances of the Issue class, each representing a different type of issue: a general issue, a feature request, a bug fix, a new feature, a refactoring, and a task. Each instance is initialized with different values for the instance variables, such as summary, description, priority, status, assignee, reporter, dueDate, estimatedTime, actualTime, comments, benefit, cost, risk, severity, reproducibility, value, complexity, impact, difficulty, and workload.

The code then uses the setter methods of each instance to update the instance variables with new values. For example, the following code updates the summary of the first issue:

(Issue new) summary: 'Fix login page'.

This code creates a new instance of the Issue class and sets the summary to 'Fix login page'.

The code also uses the getter methods of each instance to retrieve the values of the instance variables. For example, the following code retrieves the summary of the first issue:

(Issue new) summary.

This code creates a new instance of the Issue class and returns the summary, which is 'Fix login page'.

This code demonstrates the use of inheritance and polymorphism in Smalltalk. The Issue class is a superclass of the FeatureRequest, BugFix, NewFeature, Refactoring, and Task classes. Each of these subclasses inherits the instance variables and methods of the Issue class, but they also have their own unique instance variables and methods. This allows for a more flexible and extensible issue tracking system.
