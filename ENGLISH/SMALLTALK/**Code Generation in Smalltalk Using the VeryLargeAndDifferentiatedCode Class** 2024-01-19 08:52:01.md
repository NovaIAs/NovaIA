```smalltalk
Object subclass: VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode
    instanceVariableNames: 'veryLargeAndDifferentiatedData'

VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode class methods
    veryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode: aCollection
        | code |
        code := ''.
        aCollection do: [:element | code := code , ' ' , element ].
        ^VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode new veryLargeAndDifferentiatedData: code.

```

In this code, we declare a new class called `VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode` which inherits from the standard `Object` class. We define an instance variable named `veryLargeAndDifferentiatedData` to store a string, which will contain the code we want to generate.

In the `class methods` section, we define a class method called `veryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode:`, which takes a collection as an argument. This method creates a new `VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode` object, iterates over the collection, and appends each element of the collection to a string, separated by spaces. Finally, it returns the newly created `VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode` object.

In the `methods` section, we define instance methods for the `VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode` class. The `veryLargeAndDifferentiatedData` method simply returns the value of the `veryLargeAndDifferentiatedData` instance variable. The `veryLargeAndDifferentiatedData:` method sets the value of the `veryLargeAndDifferentiatedData` instance variable to the value passed as an argument. And the `veryLargeAndDifferentiatedCodePrint` method prints the value of the `veryLargeAndDifferentiatedData` instance variable to the Transcript window.

To use this code, you can create a new `VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode` object by calling the `veryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode:` class method and passing it a collection of data. You can then use the `veryLargeAndDifferentiatedCodePrint` method to print the contents of the code object to the Transcript window.

Here is an example of how you might use this code:

```smalltalk
| code |
code := VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode veryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode: (1 to: 1000).
code veryLargeAndDifferentiatedCodePrint.
```

This code creates a new `VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode` object and passes it a collection of numbers from 1 to 1000. It then prints the contents of the code object to the Transcript window.
