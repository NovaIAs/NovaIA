"This Smalltalk code defines a class called 'FractalTree' that generates a fractal tree-like structure. The fractal tree is generated recursively, starting from a single branch, and then dividing into smaller branches as it grows. The parameters 'depth' and 'angle' control the size and shape of the tree."

Explanation:

1. Class Definition:
   - We define a class named 'FractalTree' that will handle the generation and drawing of the fractal tree.

2. Constructor Method:
   - The constructor method 'initializeWithDepth:angle:' initializes a new 'FractalTree' object with the specified depth and angle.

3. 'draw' Method:
   - The 'draw' method is responsible for drawing the fractal tree using Turtle graphics.

4. 'drawBranchFrom:atAngle:' Method:
   - This recursive method draws a single branch of the fractal tree.
   - It takes the length and angle of the branch as parameters.
   - It uses Turtle graphics to move forward along the branch, recursively draw smaller branches if the depth is greater than 0, and then move backward to the starting position.

5. 'depth' and 'angle' Accessor Methods:
   - These methods allow you to get or set the 'depth' and 'angle' properties of the 'FractalTree' object.

6. Creating a Fractal Tree:
   - We create a 'FractalTree' object with a depth of 7 and an angle of 30 degrees.

7. Drawing the Fractal Tree:
   - We open a canvas in the Smalltalk world and set the color to black.
   - We disable filling to create a wireframe effect.
   - We call the 'draw' method on the 'FractalTree' object to draw the tree on the canvas.
   - Finally, we close the canvas.
