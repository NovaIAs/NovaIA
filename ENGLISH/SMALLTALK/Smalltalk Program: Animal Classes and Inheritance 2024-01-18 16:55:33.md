```smalltalk

```

**Explanation:**

The code above is a simple example of a Smalltalk program that defines a class called `Animal` with two instance variables, `name` and `species`, and a method called `speak`. The `speak` method takes a string as an argument and prints it to the console, along with the animal's name and species.

The program also defines three subclasses of `Animal`: `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Fish`. Each subclass overrides the `speak` method to print a different message.

Finally, the program creates an instance of each subclass and calls the `speak` method on each instance.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The `Animal` class definition starts with the keyword `class`.
* The `name` and `species` instance variables are defined using the `instanceVariableNames:` method.
* The `speak:` method is defined using the `method:` method. The `:` after the method name indicates that the method takes an argument.
* The subclasses of `Animal` are defined using the `subclass:` method.
* The `speak:` method is overridden in each subclass using the `override:` method.
* The program creates an instance of each subclass using the `new` method.
* The `speak:` method is called on each instance using the `speak:` message.

The output of the program is:

```
My dog, Fido, says: Woof!
My cat, Mittens, says: Meow!
My fish, Nemo, says: Blub!
```
