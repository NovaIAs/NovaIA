This code creates a pool of fraction guardians, each of which holds a fraction value. The pool is then iterated over, and each guardian's value is printed to the console.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `FractionPool guardians add: [ ( 1/2 ) asFraction ]`: This line adds a fraction guardian with the value 1/2 to the pool of guardians. The `asFraction` method is used to convert the numeric value 1/2 to a fraction object.

2. `FractionPool guardians add: [ ( 1/4 ) asFraction ]`: This line adds another fraction guardian with the value 1/4 to the pool of guardians.

3. `FractionPool guardians do: [ :guardian | ( guardian value ) printString ]`: This line iterates over the pool of guardians, passing each guardian to the block as the parameter `:guardian`. Inside the block, the `value` method is called on the guardian to get the fraction value, and the `printString` method is called on the fraction value to print it to the console.
