```

Explanation:

- The code starts with a block of code enclosed in square brackets `[]`. This block is an anonymous function that is evaluated immediately.

- The first line of the block uses the `Transcript` class to display the string `'very large and differentiated code'` in the Transcript window.

- The second line uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 1000. The loop variable `:i` is used to keep track of the current iteration.

- Inside the loop, the `Transcript` class is used again to display the string `'item '` followed by the value of `:i` converted to a string using the `asString` method.

- The `Transcript` class is used again to display the string `'done'` after the loop has completed.

- The `evaluate` method is called on the block of code to evaluate it and execute the statements inside the block.
