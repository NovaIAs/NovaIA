This code in Smalltalk defines a hierarchy of classes to represent colored rectangles.

The `Colorable` class is a mixin class that adds a `color` instance variable and a `setColor:` method to objects. The `Rectangle` class is a simple class that represents a rectangle with a width and a height. The `ColoredRectangle` class is a subclass of `Rectangle` that includes the `Colorable` mixin. This allows `ColoredRectangle` objects to have a color as well as a width and a height.

The `defaultColor` class variable is used to store the default color for all `Colorable` objects. The `color` method returns the color of a `Colorable` object. The `setColor:` method sets the color of a `Colorable` object.

The `width` and `height` instance variables are used to store the width and height of a `Rectangle` object. The `width` and `height` methods return the width and height of a `Rectangle` object. The `setWidth:` and `setHeight:` methods set the width and height of a `Rectangle` object.

The `area` method returns the area of a `Rectangle` object.

The `drawOn:` method draws a `Rectangle` object on a `Canvas` object.

The `drawOn:` method of the `ColoredRectangle` class draws a `ColoredRectangle` object on a `Canvas` object using the `color` of the `ColoredRectangle` object.
