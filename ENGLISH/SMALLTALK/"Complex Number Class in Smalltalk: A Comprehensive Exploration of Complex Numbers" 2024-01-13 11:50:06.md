"Welcome to the wonderful world of Smalltalk! 
This code is designed to showcase the power and elegance of the Smalltalk programming language. Let's dive right in!"

"Defining a Class"

"In Smalltalk, we define classes using the 'class' keyword followed by the class name. Our class is called 'ComplexNumber'."

```
class ComplexNumber

```

"Instance Variables"

"Instance variables hold data specific to each instance of the class. We define two instance variables: 'real' and 'imaginary'."

```
real: 0.0
imaginary: 0.0
```

"Constructor Method"

"The constructor method is called when a new instance is created. It initializes the instance variables."

```
initialize: aReal anImaginary
    real := aReal.
    imaginary := anImaginary.
```

"Accessor Methods"

"Accessor methods allow us to get and set the values of instance variables."

```
real
    ^real
```

```
real: aReal
    real := aReal
```

```
imaginary
    ^imaginary
```

```
imaginary: anImaginary
    imaginary := anImaginary
```

"Arithmetic Operations"

"We define methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers."

```
+ otherComplexNumber
    ^ ComplexNumber new real: self real + otherComplexNumber real
                       imaginary: self imaginary + otherComplexNumber imaginary
```

```
- otherComplexNumber
    ^ ComplexNumber new real: self real - otherComplexNumber real
                       imaginary: self imaginary - otherComplexNumber imaginary
```

```
* otherComplexNumber
    ^ ComplexNumber new real: (self real * otherComplexNumber real) - (self imaginary * otherComplexNumber imaginary)
                       imaginary: (self real * otherComplexNumber imaginary) + (self imaginary * otherComplexNumber real)
```

```
/ otherComplexNumber
    | denominator |
    denominator := otherComplexNumber real ** 2 + otherComplexNumber imaginary ** 2.

    ^ ComplexNumber new real: ((self real * otherComplexNumber real) + (self imaginary * otherComplexNumber imaginary)) / denominator
                       imaginary: ((self imaginary * otherComplexNumber real) - (self real * otherComplexNumber imaginary)) / denominator
```

"Magnitude Method"

"This method calculates the magnitude of the complex number."

```
magnitude
    ^(real ** 2 + imaginary ** 2) sqrt
```

"Angle Method"

"This method calculates the angle of the complex number."

```
angle
    ^(imaginary / real) atan
```

"Testing the ComplexNumber Class"

"Instantiate a few ComplexNumber objects and perform some operations."

```
c1 := ComplexNumber new real: 2.0 imaginary: 3.0.
c2 := ComplexNumber new real: 4.0 imaginary: 5.0.

c3 := c1 + c2.
c4 := c1 - c2.
c5 := c1 * c2.
c6 := c1 / c2.

c1 magnitude.
c1 angle.
```
