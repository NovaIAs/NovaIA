This code defines a class called `ComplexNumber` in the Smalltalk programming language. Here's an explanation of the code:

1. `Object subclass: ComplexNumber [ ... ]`: This line creates a new subclass of the `Object` class called `ComplexNumber`.

2. `instanceVariableNames: { real imaginary }`: This line defines the instance variables of the `ComplexNumber` class. Instance variables are used to store the state of an object. In this case, the `ComplexNumber` class has two instance variables: `real` and `imaginary`.

3. `real` and `imaginary`: These are the instance variables that will be used to store the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively.

4. `initialize: aReal anImaginary [ ... ]`: This is the constructor method for the `ComplexNumber` class. It takes two arguments, `aReal` and `anImaginary`, and initializes the `real` and `imaginary` instance variables with these values.

5. `real` and `imaginary`: These are getter methods that return the values of the `real` and `imaginary` instance variables, respectively.

6. `asString`: This method converts a complex number to a string representation. It uses the `String streamContents:` method to create a string stream and then uses the `nextPutAll:` and `nextPut:` methods to write the real and imaginary parts of the complex number to the stream.

7. `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`: These methods implement the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators for complex numbers. They take another `ComplexNumber` object as an argument and perform the corresponding operation on the real and imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.

8. `abs`: This method calculates the absolute value of a complex number. It uses the `Math sqrt:` method to calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

9. `angle`: This method calculates the angle of a complex number. It uses the `Math atan2:` method to calculate the arctangent of the imaginary part divided by the real part of the complex number.

This code provides a comprehensive implementation of complex numbers in Smalltalk, including methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, absolute value, and angle calculation.
