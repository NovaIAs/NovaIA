```
**Explanation:**

1. We define a class called "BankAccount" to represent a bank account. This class has instance variables to store account information such as the account number, balance, and interest rate.

2. We define methods like "initialize", "getAccountNumber", "getBalance", "getInterestRate", "deposit", "withdraw", and "calculateInterest" to initialize the object and perform various operations on the account.

3. We create a new BankAccount object, deposit and withdraw money, and calculate the interest earned.

4. Finally, we print the account information and the interest earned to the console.

This code demonstrates how to create a class with instance variables and methods in Smalltalk, and how to interact with objects of that class.
