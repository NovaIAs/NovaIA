**Explanation:**

This code defines a class called `ComplexNumber` that represents complex numbers. It includes methods for performing basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), as well as methods for calculating the magnitude and argument of a complex number. The code also defines a `toString` method that returns a string representation of a complex number.

To use the `ComplexNumber` class, you can create instances of the class using the `new` method. For example, the following code creates two complex numbers:

```smalltalk
c1 := ComplexNumber new: 3 :4.
c2 := ComplexNumber new: 5 :-2.
```

You can then use the arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) to perform arithmetic operations on the complex numbers. For example, the following code adds the two complex numbers `c1` and `c2`:

```smalltalk
c3 := c1 + c2.
```

The result of this operation is stored in the variable `c3`. You can use the `toString` method to print the value of `c3` to the Transcript:

```smalltalk
Transcript show: 'c3 = ', c3 toString, '
'.
```

This will print the following output to the Transcript:

```
c3 = 8 + 2i
```

You can also use the `magnitude` and `argument` methods to calculate the magnitude and argument of a complex number. For example, the following code calculates the magnitude of the complex number `c1`:

```smalltalk
magnitude := c1 magnitude.
```

The result of this operation is stored in the variable `magnitude`. You can use the `show` method to print the value of `magnitude` to the Transcript:

```smalltalk
Transcript show: 'Magnitude of c1 = ', magnitude, '
'.
```

This will print the following output to the Transcript:

```
Magnitude of c1 = 5
```

Similarly, you can use the `argument` method to calculate the argument of a complex number. For example, the following code calculates the argument of the complex number `c1`:

```smalltalk
argument := c1 argument.
```

The result of this operation is stored in the variable `argument`. You can use the `show` method to print the value of `argument` to the Transcript:

```smalltalk
Transcript show: 'Argument of c1 = ', argument, '
'.
```

This will print the following output to the Transcript:

```
Argument of c1 = 0.9272952180016122
```
