This code defines a new class called `MyCustomObject` that inherits from the `Object` class. The `MyCustomObject` class has an instance variable called `anAttribute`, which is a list.

The `class initialize` method is called when the class is first loaded. In this method, we create a new list and assign it to the `anAttribute` instance variable.

The `initialize` method is called when a new instance of the class is created. In this method, we also create a new list and assign it to the `anAttribute` instance variable.

The `getAttribute` method returns the value of the `anAttribute` instance variable.

The `setAttribute:` method sets the value of the `anAttribute` instance variable to the given object.

The `printAttribute` method prints the value of the `anAttribute` instance variable to the Transcript.

To use the `MyCustomObject` class, you can create a new instance of the class like this:

```smalltalk
anObject := MyCustomObject new.
```

You can then access the `anAttribute` instance variable of the object like this:

```smalltalk
anAttribute := anObject getAttribute.
```

You can also set the value of the `anAttribute` instance variable like this:

```smalltalk
anObject setAttribute: aList.
```

You can print the value of the `anAttribute` instance variable like this:

```smalltalk
anObject printAttribute.
```
