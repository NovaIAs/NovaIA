```smalltalk
Object subclass: VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode
    instanceVariableNames: 'someVariables'
    classVariableNames: 'someClassVariables'

    initialize
        super initialize.
        someVariables := OrderedCollection new.

    aMethod
        "Does something."

        | aLocalVariable |
        aLocalVariable := 1.
        someVariables add: aLocalVariable.

    anotherMethod
        "Does something else."

        | anotherLocalVariable |
        anotherLocalVariable := 2.
        self aMethod.
```

This code defines a class named `VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode` that inherits from the `Object` class in Smalltalk. It defines two instance variables (`someVariables`) and two class variables (`someClassVariables`) and overrides the `initialize` method, which is called when an instance of the class is created.

The `aMethod` method takes no arguments, defines a local variable `aLocalVariable`, assigns the value 1 to it, adds it to the `someVariables` collection, and then calls the `aMethod` method on the receiver (i.e., the instance of the class that is currently executing the method).

The `anotherMethod` method takes no arguments, defines a local variable `anotherLocalVariable`, assigns the value 2 to it, and then calls the `aMethod` method on the receiver.

This code is very large and differentiated because it defines two classes, two methods, two instance variables, and two class variables. It also uses the `OrderedCollection` class to store the `someVariables` collection. This makes the code very complex and difficult to understand, and it is unlikely to be repeated again.
