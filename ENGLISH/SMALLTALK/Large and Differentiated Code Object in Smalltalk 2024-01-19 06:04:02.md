Explanation:

1. "Class variables" section:

    * `classVariableName` is a class variable of the `VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode` class. It can be accessed using the syntax `VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode classVariableName`. Class variables are shared among all instances of the class.

2. "Instance variables" section:

    * `instanceVariableName` is an instance variable of the `VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode` class. It can be accessed using the syntax `anInstance instanceVariableName`, where `anInstance` is an instance of the class. Instance variables are unique to each instance of the class.

3. "Methods" section:

    * `aMethod` is a method of the `VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode` class. It can be called using the syntax `anInstance aMethod`, where `anInstance` is an instance of the class. Methods define the behavior of a class.

4. Method body:

    * `| localVariable |` is a local variable declaration. Local variables are temporary variables that exist only within the method in which they are declared.
    * `localVariable := 1 + 2.` assigns the value of `1 + 2` to the local variable `localVariable`.
    * `^ localVariable` returns the value of the local variable `localVariable` as the result of the method.

5. Creating an instance of the class:

    * `anInstance := VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode new.` creates an instance of the `VeryLargeAndDifferentiatedCode` class and assigns it to the variable `anInstance`.

6. Calling a method on the instance:

    * `result := anInstance aMethod.` calls the `aMethod` method on the instance `anInstance` and assigns the result to the variable `result`.

7. Printing the result:

    * `Transcript show: result.` prints the value of the variable `result` to the transcript, which is a window where the results of Smalltalk expressions are displayed.
